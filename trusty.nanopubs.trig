  sub:abstract c4o:hasContent "In this paper we examine the use of crowdsourcing as a means to master Linked Data quality problems that are difficult to solve automatically. We base our approach on the analysis of the most common errors encountered in Linked Data sources, and a classification of these errors according to the extent to which they are likely to be amenable to crowdsourcing. We then propose and compare different crowdsourcing approaches to identify these Linked Data quality issues, employing the DBpedia dataset as our use case: (i) a contest targeting the Linked Data expert community, and (ii) paid microtasks published on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We secondly focus on adapting the Find-Fix-Verify crowdsourcing pattern to exploit the strengths of experts and lay workers. By testing two distinct Find-Verify workflows (lay users only and experts verified by lay users) we reveal how to best combine different crowds’ complementary aptitudes in quality issue detection. The results show that a combination of the two styles of crowdsourcing is likely to achieve more efficient results than each of them used in isolation, and that human computation is a promising and affordable way to enhance the quality of Linked Data.";

However, seamless consumption of LD in applications is still very lim- ited given the varying quality of the data published in the Linked Open Data (LOD) Cloud [18,44]. This is the result of a combination of data- and process- related factors. The data sets being released into the LOD Cloud are – apart from any factual flaws they may contain – very diverse in terms of formats, struc- ture, and vocabulary. This heterogeneity and the fact that some kinds of data tend to be more challenging to lift to RDF than others make it hard to avoid errors, especially when the translation happens automatically.";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "Crowdsourcing [19] refers to the process of solving a problem formulated as a task by reaching out to a large network of (often previously unknown) people. One of the most popular forms of crowdsourcing are ‘microtasks’ (or ‘microwork’), which consists on di- viding a task into several smaller subtasks that can be independently solved. Conditional on the tackled prob- lem, the level of task granularity can vary (microtasks whose results need to be aggregated vs. macrotasks, which require filtering to identify the most valuable contributions); as can the incentive structure (e.g., pay- ments per unit of useful work vs. prizes for top par- ticipants in a contest). Another major design decision in the crowdsourcing workflow is the selection of the crowd. While many (micro)tasks can be performed by untrained workers, others might require more skilled human participants, especially in specialized fields of expertise, such as LD. Of course, expert intervention usually comes at a higher price; either in monetary re- wards or in the form of effort to recruit participants in another setting, such as volunteer work. Microtask crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) 1 on the other hand offer a formidable and readily-available workforce at relatively low fees.";

We did so building on previous work of ours [43] which analyzed common quality prob- lems encountered in Linked Data sources and classi- fied them according to the extent to which they could be amenable to crowdsourcing. The first research ques- tion explored is hence: RQ1: Is it feasible to detect quality issues in LD sets via crowdsourcing mecha- nisms? This question aims at establishing a general un- derstanding if crowdsourcing approaches can be used to find issues in LD sets and if so, to what degree they are an efficient and effective solution. Secondly, given the option of different crowds, we formulate RQ2: In a crowdsourcing approach, can we employ unskilled lay users to identify quality issues in RDF triple data or to what extent is expert validation needed and desirable? As a subquestion to RQ2, we also examined which type of crowd is most suitable to detect which type of quality issue (and, conversely, which errors they are prone to make). With these questions, we are interested (i) in learning to what extent we can exploit the cost- efficiency of lay users, or if the quality of error detec- tion is prohibitively low. We (ii) investigate how well experts generally perform in a crowdsourcing setting and if and how they outperform lay users. And lastly, (iii) it is of interest if one of the two distinct approaches performs well in areas that might not be a strength of the other method and crowd.";

The task consisted solely of the rating of a formerly indicated quality is- sue for a triple as correctly or wrongly assigned. This Verify step was, in fact, able to improve the preci- sion of both Find stages substantially. In particular, the experts’ Find stage results could be improved to precision levels of around 0.9 in the Verify stage for two error types which showed to score much lower for an expert-only Find approach. The worker-worker Find-Verify strategy yielded also better results than the Find-only worker approach, and for one error type even reached slightly better precision than the expert-worker model. All in all, we show that (i) a Find-Verify combination of experts and lay users is likely to pro- duce the best results, but that (ii) they are not superior to expert-only evaluation in all cases. We demonstrate also that (iii) lay users-only Find-Verify approaches can be a viable alternative for detection of LD qual- ity issues if experts are not available and that they cer- tainly outperform Find-only lay user workflows.";

In our previous work [44], we compiled a list of data quality dimensions (criteria) applica- ble to Linked Data quality assessment. Afterwards, we mapped these dimensions to DBpedia [43]. A sub-set of four dimensions of the original framework were found particularly relevant in this setting: Ac- curacy, Relevancy, Representational-Consistency and Interlinking. To provide a comprehensive analysis of DBpedia quality, we further divided these four cate- gories of problems into sub-categories.

In particular, contests as means to successfully involve experts in advancing science have a long-standing tradition in research, e.g., the Darpa challenges 3 and NetFlix. 4 Usually, contests as crowdsourcing mechanisms are open for a medium to long period of time in order to attract high quality contributions.

As discussed in Section 3, this crowd- sourcing pattern allows for increasing the overall quality of the results while maintaining competitive monetary costs when applying other crowdsourcing ap- proaches. Our implementation of the Find-Fix-Verify pattern is tailored to assess the quality of Linked Data sets that are automatically created from other sources. Such is the case of DBpedia [24], a data set created by extracting knowledge from Wikipedia via declarative mediator/wrapper pattern. The wrappers are the result of a crowdsourced community effort of contributors to the DBpedia project. To crowdsource the assessment of triples of data sets like DBpedia, we devise a two-fold approach including the following stages: Find and Verify. In the Find stage, the crowd was requested to detect LD quality issues in a set of RDF triples, and annotate them with the corresponding issue(s) if applicable. We define the Find Stage as follows:";

The first workflow combines LD experts and microtask workers: This workflow leverages the expertise of Linked Data experts in a contest to find and classify erroneous triples according to a pre-defined quality taxonomy, while the workers verify the outcome of the contest. The second workflow entirely relies on microtask crowdsourcing to perform the Find and Verify stages. As discussed in Section 3, these crowdsourcing approaches exhibit different characteristics in terms of the types of tasks they can be applied to, the way the results are consolidated and exploited, and the audiences they target. Therefore, in this work we study the impact on involving different types of crowd to detect quality issues in RDF triples: LD experts in the contest and workers in the microtasks. Table 1 presents a summary of the two approaches as they have been used in this work for LD quality assessment purposes.";

As a basic means to avoid spam, each user first has to login with his Google account through OAuth2. Then she is presented with three op- tions to choose a resource from DBpedia: (i) ‘Any’, for random selection; (ii) ‘Per Class’, where she may choose a resource belonging to a particular class of her interest; and (iii) ‘Manual’, where she may pro- vide a URI of a resource herself. Once a resource is selected following one of these alternatives, the user is presented with a table in which each row corresponds to an RDF triple of that resource. The next step is the actual quality assessment at triple level. The user is provided with the link to the corresponding Wikipedia page of the given resource in order to offer more con- text for the evaluation. If she detects a triple containing a problem, she checks the box ‘Is Wrong’. Moreover, she assigns specific quality problems (according to the classification devised in [43]) to troublesome triples, as depicted in Figure 2. The user can assess as many triples from a resource as desired, or select another re- source to evaluate.";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "The execution of this stage, as depicted in Figure 1, starts by generating the microtasks from F i , i.e., the sets of RDF triples T and quality issues Q to crowdsource. In addition, a parameter α can be specified as a threshold on the number of questions to include in a single microtask. Algorithm 1 presents the procedure to create the microtasks. The algorithm firstly per- forms a pruning step (line 2) to remove triples that do not require human assessment. For instance, in our im- plementation, the function prune discards RDF triples whose URIs could not be dereferenced. The algorithm then proceeds to build microtasks such that each microtask only contains triples associated with a specific resource, similar to the interfaces of the TripleCheck-Mate tool used in the contest. The set S contains all the resources that appear as subjects in the set of triples T (line 3). For each subject, the algorithm builds the set of triples T 0 associated with the subject (line 5), and the creation of microtasks begins (line 6). From the pool T 0 , a triple t is selected (line 8) and the corresponding human-readable information is extracted (line 9). In this stage, similar to the TripleCheckMate, each microtask requires the workers to browse all the possible quality issues, therefore, the set of issues to assess on triple t is equal to Q in each microtask cre- ated (line 10). In case that the number of questions in the current microtask exceeds the threshold α, a new microtask is then created. The definition of the parameter α allows for avoiding the creation of very long tasks, i.e., when the number of triples with the same subject is large; appropriate values of α enables the creation of tasks than can still be solved in a reasonable time, consistent with the concept of microtask (a short task). Algorithm 1 continues creating microtasks for all the triples of a resource (lines 7-16), for all the resources (lines 4-18). The outcome of the algorithm is a set M of microtasks to assess the quality of the triples in T according to the issues in Q.";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "An important aspect when generating microtasks from RDF data (or machine-readable data in general) is developing useful human-understandable interfaces (Algorithm 1, line 9) for the target non-expert crowds. In microtasks, optimal user interfaces reduce ambigu- ity as well as the probability to retrieve erroneous answers from the crowd due to a misinterpretation of the task. Therefore, before start to resolve one of our tasks, the crowd workers were instructed with details and ex- amples about each quality issue. After reading the in- structions, workers proceed to resolve the given task. Figure 3 depicts the interface of a microtask generated for the Find stage in our approach. To display each triple, we retrieved the values of the foaf:name or rdfs:label properties for subjects, predicates, and datatypes. The name of languages in language-tagged strings were parsed using a conversion table from the best current practices BCP 47 [7], as suggested by the RDF specification 7 . Language tags and datatypes of objects were highlighted, such that workers can easily iden tify them 8 . Additionally, in order to provide contextual information, we implemented a simple wrapper which extracts the corresponding data encoded in the infobox of the Wikipedia article associated with the resource – specified via foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf . The crowd has the pos- sibility to select one or several quality issues per triple.";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "The generation of microtasks in this stage is presented in Algorithm 2. This algorithm groups the triples in T obtained from the previous stage by quality issue, which enables the workers to focus on one quality issue at the time. The input of this stage is the set of triples to assess T and their mappings to quality issues φ̇(.). The parameter β specifies the number of questions to include in a single microtask. The algorithm firstly performs a pruning step (line 2) to remove certain triples. For instance, a triple t that was considered ‘correct’ in the Find stage ( φ̇(t) = ∅) is discarded, consistently with the definition of the Find-Fix-Verify pattern [3]. Also, in our implementation, the function prune discards answers whose inter-rater agreement were not higher than a certian value. The algorithm then proceeds to build microtasks such that each microtask only contains triples associated with a specific quality issue. For each answer from the previous stage, the algorithm decomposes the set of quality issues φ̇(t) of a triple t into singletons (lines 3-7). The set Q contains all the quality issues present in the set of triples T (line 8). For each quality issue q (line 9), the algorithm processes all triples associated with that quality issue (lines 11-18). The algorithm extracts human-readable information about the triples (line 12) and appends it to the microtask (line 13). In case that the number of questions in the current microtask exceeds the threshold β, a new microtask is then created. The outcome of the algorithm is a set M of microtasks to assess the quality of the triples in T according to the issues iden- tified in the Find stage ( φ̇(.)).";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "When analyzing the number of microtasks gener- ated in each stage, the Verify stage seems to produce more tasks than the Find stage. This is a consequence of simplifying the difficulty of the microtasks in the Verify stage, where workers have to assess only one type of quality issue at the time. However, in practice, the number of microtasks generated in the Verify stage is not necessarily larger. For instance, in our experiments with LD experts and crowd workers, we ob- served that large portions of the triples are not anno- tated with quality issues in the Find stage. Since Algorithm 2 prunes triples with no quality issues (consistently with the definition of the Find-Fix-Verify pattern), the subset of triples crowdsourced in the Verify stage is considerably smaller than the original set, hence the number of microtasks to verify is reduced.";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "Two of the authors of this paper (MA, AZ) generated a gold standard for two samples of the crowd- sourced triples. To generate the gold standard, each author independently evaluated the triples. After an individual assessment, they compared their results and resolved the conflicts via mutual agreement. The first sample evaluated corresponds to the set of triples obtained from the contest and submitted to MTurk. The inter-rater agreement between the authors for this first sample and was 0.4523 for object values, 0.5554 for datatypes, and 0.5666 for interlinks. For the second sample, we analyzed a subset from the triples identified in the Find stage by the crowd as ‘incorrect’. The subset has the same distribution of quality issues and triples as the one assessed in the first sample: 509 triples for object values, 341 for datatypes/language tags, and 223 for interlinks. We measured the inter- rater agreement for this second sample and was 0.6363 for object values, 0.8285 for datatypes, and 0.7074 for interlinks. The inter-rater agreement values were calculated using the Cohen’s kappa measure [6], designed for measuring agreement among two annotators. Dis- agreement arose in the object value triples when one of the reviewers marked number values which are rounded up to the next round number as correct. For example, the length of the course of the “1949 Ulster Grand Prix” was 26.5Km in Wikipedia but rounded up to 27Km in DBpedia. In case of datatypes, most dis- agreements were considering the datatype “number” of the value for the property “year” as correct. For the links, those containing unrelated content, were marked as correct by one of the reviewers since the link existed in the Wikipedia page.";

In total, there were 268 inter-evaluations for which we calculated the triple-based inter-agreement (adjusting the observed agreement with agreement by chance) to be 0.38. For the microtasks, we measured the inter-rater agreement values between a maximum of 5 workers for each type of task using Fleiss’ kappa measure [10]. While the inter-rater agreement between workers for the interlinking was high (0.7396), the ones for object values and datatypes was moderate to low with 0.5348 and 0.4960, respectively.

Most of the missing or incomplete values that are extracted from Wikipedia occur with the predicates related to dates, for example: (2005 Six Nations Championship, Date, 12). In these cases, the experts and workers presented a similar behavior, classifying 110 and 107 triples correctly, respectively, out of the 117 assessed triples for this class. The difference in precision between the two approaches can be explained as follows. There were 52 DBpedia triples whose values might seem erroneous, although they were cor- rectly extracted from Wikipedia. One example of these triples is: (English (programming language), Influenced by, ?) . We found out that the LD experts classified all these triples as incorrect. In contrast, the workers successfully answered that 50 out of this 52 were correct, since they could easily compare the DB- pedia and Wikipedia values in the HITs.";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "In order to understand the previous results, we analyzed the performance of experts and workers at a more fine-grained level. We calculated the frequency of occurrences of datatypes in the assessed triples (see Figure 6a) and reported the number of true positives (TP) and false positives (FP) achieved by both crowdsourcing methods for each type of task. Figure 6b depicts these results. The most notorious result in this task is the assessment performance for the datatype “number”. The experts effectively identified triples where the datatype was incorrectly assigned as “number” 13 for instance, in the triple where the crowd was confused and determined that datatype was correct, thus generating a large number of false positives. Nevertheless, it could be argued that the data type “number” in the previous example is not completely incorrect, when being unaware of the fact that there are more specific data types for representing time units. Under this assumption, the precision of the crowd would have been 0.8475 and 0.8211 for first answer and majority voting, respectively.";

In total, we submitted to the crowd 30, 658 RDF triples. The microtasks were resolved by 187 distinct workers who identified 26, 835 triples as erroneous in 14 days, and classified them into the three quality issues studied in this work. Then, we selected samples from triples identified as erroneous in the Find stage by at least two workers from the crowd. This allowed us to fairly compare the outcome of the Verify stage from both workflows. Each sample contains the exact same number of triples that were crowdsourced in the Verify Stage in the first workflow, i.e., 509 triples with object value issues, 341 with data type or language tag issues, and 223 with interlinks issues. All triples crowdsourced in the Verify Stage were assessed by 141 workers in seven days. A summary of these results and further details are presented in Table 5.";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "Similar to the previous experiment, we measured the inter-rater agreement achieved by the crowd in both stages using the Fleiss’ kappa metric. In the Find stage the inter-rater agreement of workers was 0.2695, while in the Verify stage, the the crowd achieved substantial agreement for all the types of tasks: 0.6300 for object values, 0.7957 for data types or language tags, and 0.7156 for interlinks. In comparison to the first workflow, the crowd in the Verify stage achieved higher agreement. This suggests that the triples identified as erroneous in the Find stage were easier to interpret or process by the crowd. Table 6 reports on the precision achieved by the crowd in each stage. It is important to notice that in this workflow we crowdsourced all the triples that could have been explored by the LD experts in the contest. In this way, we evaluate the performance of lay user and experts under similar conditions. During the Find stage, the crowd achieved low values of precision for the three types of tasks, which suggests that this stage is still very challenging for lay users. In the following we present further details on the results for each type of task.";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "In the Verify stage of this type of task, the crowd outperformed the precision of the Find stage, achieving values of 0.5510 for the ‘first answer’ setting and 0.8723 with ‘majority voting’. This major improvement on the precision put in evidence the importance of having the a multi-validation pattern like Find-Fix-Verify in which initial errors can be reduced in subsequent iterations. Congruently with the behavior observed in the first workflow, MTurk workers perform well when verifying language-tagged literals. Further- more, the high values of inter-rater agreement con- firms that the crowd is consistently good in this par- ticular scenario. Figure 7b depicts the results of the ‘majority voting’ setting when classifying triples correctly, i.e., true positives (TP) and true negatives (TN), vs. misclassifying triples, i.e. false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN). We can observe that the crowd is exceptionally successful in identifying correct triples that were classified as erroneous in the previous stage (true negatives). This can be confirmed by the high value of accuracy 17 (0.9531) achieved by the crowd in this stage with ‘majority voting’. A closer inspection to the six false positives revealed that in three cases the crowd misclassified triples whose object is a proper noun, for instance, (Tiszaszentimre, name, Tiszaszen- timre@en) and (Ferrari Mythos, label, Ferrari Mythos@de) ; in the other three cases the object of the triple corresponds to a common noun or text in the following languages: Italian, Portuguese, and English, for example, (Book, label, Libro@it) .";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "In the Find stage, the crowd achieved similar values of precision in both settings ‘first answer’ and ‘majority voting’. Furthermore, in this stage the crowd achieved higher precision (0.5291 for ‘majority voting’) than in the Find stage. From the 167 RDF triples with predicate rdf:type, the crowd correctly classified 67 triples. Although the false positives were reduced in the Verify stage, the number of misclassified triples with RDF resources as objects are still high. Since the value of inter-rater agreement for this type of task is high, we can deduce that false positives are not necessarily generated by chance but the crowd recurrently confirms that these RDF triples are incorrect. These results suggest that assessing triples with RDF resources as objects without a proper rendering (human-readable information) is challenging for the crowd. Regarding the triples whose objects are external Web pages, in the Find stage the crowd correctly classified 35 out of the 36 triples, which is consistent with the behavior observed for this type of triples assessed in the Verify stage of the first workflow.";

However, even in this case it is not possible to provide a precision since RDFUnit runs through the whole set of resources and possibly catches errors the LD experts didn’t catch since it considers the ontological schema. This is because the LD experts performed triple based evalua- tion using the TripleCheckMate tool, which does not provide schema information directly. Thus, only those experts who are conversant with the schema might be able to identify those errors. Examples of such inconsistencies are datatype detection that is not defined in the ontology e.g. dates vs numbers (“1935”ˆˆxsd:integer ) or erroneous language tags. Also, rdfs:domain violations were not reported from the LD experts since for every triple they had to cross-check the ontology definitions for the evaluated property and the rdf:type statements of the resource. Similar combinations apply for all the other patterns types described in Table 8. RDFUnit was running beyond the isolated triple level that the LD experts and crowd were evaluating and was checking various combinations of triples.";

The data collected for each type of task suggests that the effort of LD experts must be applied on tasks demanding specific-domain skills beyond common knowledge. For instance, LD experts successfully identified issues on very specific datatypes, e.g., when time units are simply annotated as numbers ( xsd:Integer or xsd:Float ). In the same type of task, workers focused on assessing triples annotated with language tags, instead of datatypes like the experts. The MTurk crowd has proven to be very skilled at verifying whether literals are written in a certain language. In addition, workers were exceptionally good and efficient at performing comparisons between data entries, specially when some contextual information is provided.";

Although the experimental data does not provide insights into this behavior, we are inclined to believe that this is due to the relatively higher effort required by this specific type of task, which involves checking an additional site outside the TripleCheckMate tool. Although the crowd outperformed the experts in finding incorrect ‘interlinks’, the MTurk crowd is not sufficiently capable of assessing links that correspond to RDF resources.

In microtask settings, the first challenge is then to reduce the amount of tasks submitted to the crowd and the number of requested assign- ments (different answers), since both of these factors determine the overall cost of crowdsourcing projects. For the Find stage, Algorithm 1 generated 2, 339 HITs to crowdsource 68, 976 RDF triples, consistently with the property stated by Proposition 2. In our experiments, we approved a total of 2, 294 task solutions in the Find stage and, considering the payment per HIT (US$ 0.06), the total cost of this evaluation resulted in US$ 137.58. Furthermore, in the Verify stage, the cost of submitting to MTurk the problematic triples found by the experts was only US$ 43.";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "From a process point of view, [41] introduced a methodology for publishing Linked Data. They dis- cussed activities which theoretically could be subject to crowdsourcing, but did not discuss such aspects explicitly. Similarly, [25] tried to map ontology engineering methodologies to Linked Data practice, drawing on insights from interviews with practitioners and quantitative analysis. A more focused account of the use of human and crowd intelligence in Linked Data man- agement is offered in [36]. The authors investigated several technically oriented scenarios in order to identify lower-level tasks and analyze the extent to which they can be feasibly automated. In this context, feasibility referred primarily to the trade-off between the effort associated with the usage of a given tool targeting automation - including aspects such as getting familiar with the tool, but more importantly creating training data sets and examples, configuring the tool and validating (intermediary) results - and the quality of the outcomes. The fundamental question the work attempted to answer was related to ours, though not focused on quality assurance and repair – their aim was come up with patterns for human and machine-driven computation, which could service semantic data management scenarios effectively. This was also at the core of [35], which took the main findings of this analysis a step further and proposed a methodology to build incentivized Semantic Web applications, including guidelines for mechanism design which are compatible to our fix-find-verify workflow. They have also analyzed motivators and incentives for several types of Semantic Web tasks, from ontology population to se- mantic annotation.";

Games with a purpose, which capitalize on entertain- ment, intellectual challenge, competition, and reputation, offer another mechanism to engage with a broad user base. In the field of semantic technologies, the OntoGame series proposes several games that deal with the task of data interlinking, be that in its ontology alignment instance (SpotTheLink [38]) or multimedia interlinking (SeaFish [37]). Similar ideas are imple- mented in GuessWhat?!, a selection-agreement game which uses URIs from DBpedia, Freebase and OpenCyc as input to the interlinking process [27]. While OntoGame looks into game mechanics and game narratives and their applicability to finding similar enti- ties and other types of correspondences, our research studies an alternative crowdsourcing strategy that is based on financial rewards in a microtask platform. Most relevant for our work are the experiments comparing games with a purpose and paid microtasks, which showed the complementarity of the two forms of crowdsourcing [32,9].";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "Web data quality assessment. Existing frameworks for the quality assessment of the Web of Data can be broadly classified as automated (e.g. [15]), semiautomated (e.g. [11]) and manual (e.g.[4,29]). In particular, for the quality issues used in our experiments, [15] performs quality assessment on links but it fully automated and thus is limited as it does allow the user to choose the input dataset. Also, the incor- rect interlinks detected require human verification as they do not take the semantics into account. On the other hand, for detection of incorrect object values and datatypes and literals, the SWIQA framework [14] can be used by utilizing different outlier and clustering techniques. However, it lacks specific syntactical rules to detect all of the errors and requires knowledge of the underlying schema for the user to specify these rules. Other researchers analyzed the quality of Web [5] and RDF [17] data. The second study focuses on errors occurred during the publication of Linked Data sets. Recently, a study [18] looked into four million RD- F/XML documents to analyze Linked Data conformance. These studies performed large-scale quality assessment on LD but are often limited in their ability to produce interpretable results, demand user expertise or are bound to a given data set.";

The approach described in [13] advocates the use of SPARQL and SPIN for RDF data quality assessment. In a similar way, Fürber et al. [12] define a set of generic SPARQL queries to identify missing or illegal literal values and datatypes and functional dependency violations. Another related approach is the Pellet Integrity Constraint Validator ICV 23 . Pellet ICV translates OWL integrity constraints into SPARQL queries. A more lightweight RDF constraint syntax, decoupled from SPARQL, is offered from Shape Expressions (ShEx) [31] and IBM Resource Shapes 24 .";

How do you ensure that your extractor does not create extraction errors like they are about to occur in the DBpedia infobox which resulted in the RDF triple under consideration? What if both - your wikipedia infobox extractor and the DBpedia RDF triple - show the very same error? Many problems of the DBpedia extractors arise from wrong infobox information, because many wikipedia authors don't care about infobox conventions. Can these kind of errors be detected at all with your crowdsourcing tool (based on the very same mechanisms to give a hint to the crowdworker)?";

Therefore, I'd recommend to soften the claims of generality of the presented results and to clearly state that they are \"proved\" only on DBpedia. I'm sure the authors can speculate to what extent those results can be considered general, but at the present moment I believe they cannot affirm that they fully addressed the research questions as they are introduced.";

Some examples: - specific datatype objects (like dates vs. numbers, which are definitely ok to be mistaken) - owl:sameAs links (which maybe were interpreted in a \"purist\" way by LD experts who can be careful in accepting those triples because of their logical implications) - rdf:type triples among the incorrect link issues (apparently unclear for the MTurk workers, but partially also to me: why did rdf:type triples were considered among the \"links\" instead of the \"values\"?) - DBpedia translation-specific triples (which do not make any sense in such an evaluation setting, and should have been filtered out in the first place).";

  sub:abstract c4o:hasContent "The Web has evolved into a huge mine of knowledge carved in different forms, the predominant one still being the free-text document. This motivates the need for Intelligent Web-reading Agents: hypothetically, they would skim through disparate Web sources corpora and generate meaningful structured assertions to fuel Knowledge Bases (KBs). Ultimately, comprehensive KBs, like Wikidata and DBpedia, play a fundamental role to cope with the issue of information overload. On account of such vision, this paper depicts the F ACT E XTRACTOR , a complete Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline which reads an input textual corpus and produces machine-readable statements. Each statement is supplied with a confidence score and undergoes a disambiguation step via entity linking, thus allowing the assignment of KB-compliant URIs. The system implements four research contributions: it (1) executes N-ary relation extraction by applying the Frame Semantics linguistic theory, as opposed to binary techniques; it (2) jointly populates both the T-Box and the A-Box of the target KB; it (3) relies on a lightweight NLP machinery, namely part-of-speech tagging only; it (4) enables a completely supervised yet reasonably priced machine learning environment through a crowdsourcing strategy. We assess our approach by setting the target KB to DBpedia and by considering a use case of 52, 000 Italian Wikipedia soccer player articles. Out of those, we yield a dataset of more than 213, 000 triples with a 78.5% F 1 . We corroborate the evaluation via (i) a performance comparison with a baseline system, as well as (ii) an analysis of the T-Box and A-Box augmentation capabilities. The outcomes are incorporated into the Italian DBpedia chapter, can be queried through its SPARQL endpoint, and/or downloaded as standalone data dumps. The codebase is released as free software and is publicly available in the DBpedia Association repository.";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "The World Wide Web is nowadays one of the most prominent sources of information and knowledge. De- spite the constantly increasing availability of semi-structured or structured data, a major portion of its content is still represented in an unstructured form, namely free text: deciphering its meaning is a complex task for machines and yet relies on subjective human interpretations. Hence, there is an ever growing need for Intelligent Web-reading Agents, i.e., Artificial Intelligence systems that can read and understand human language in documents across the Web. Ideally, these agents should be robust enough to interchange between heterogeneous sources with agility, while maintaining equivalent reading capabilities. More specifically, given a set of input corpora (where an item corresponds to the textual content of a Web source), they should be able to navigate from corpus to corpus and to extract compa- rable structured assertions out of each one. Ultimately, the collected data would feed a target Knowledge Base (KB), namely a repository that encodes areas of human intelligence into a richly shaped representation. Typically, KBs are composed of graphs, where real-world and abstract entities are bound together through relationships, and classified according to a formal description of the world, i.e., an ontology.";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "In this scenario, the encyclopedia Wikipedia contains a huge amount of data, which may represent the best digital approximation of human knowledge. Recent efforts, most notably DB PEDIA [23], F REEBASE [8], YAGO [21], and W IKIDATA [31], attempt to extract semi-structured data from Wikipedia in order to build KBs that are proven useful for a variety of applications, such as question answering, entity summarization and entity linking (EL), just to name a few. The idea has not only attracted a continuously rising commitment of research communities, but has also become a substantial focus of the largest Web companies. As an anecdotal yet remarkable proof, Google acquired Freebase in 2010, 1 embedded it in its K NOWLEDGE G RAPH , 2 and has lately opted to shut it down to the public. 3 Currently, it is foreseen that Freebase data will eventually migrate to Wikidata 4 via the primary sources tool, 5 which aims at standardizing the flow for data donations.";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "However, the reliability of a general-purpose KB like Wikidata is an essential requirement to ensure credible (thus high-quality) content: as a support for their trustworthiness, data should be validated against third-party resources. Even though the Wikidata community strongly agrees on the concern, 6 few efforts have been approached towards this direction. The addition of references to external (i.e., non-Wikimedia), authoritative Web sources can be viewed as a form of validation. Consequently, such real-world setting further consolidates the need for an intelligent agent that harvests structured data from raw text and produces e.g., Wikidata statements with reference URLs. Besides the prospective impact on the KB augmentation and quality, the agent would also dramatically shift the burden of manual data addition and curation, by pushing the (intended) fully human-driven flow towards an assisted paradigm, where automatic suggestions of pre-packaged statements just require to be approved or rejected. Figure 1 depicts the current state of the primary sources tool interface for Wikidata editors, which is in active development yet illustrates such future technological directions. Our system already takes part in the process, as it feeds the tool back-end.";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "On the other hand, the DBpedia E XTRACTION F RAMEWORK 7 is pretty much mature when dealing with Wikipedia semi-structured content like infoboxes, links and categories. Nevertheless, unstructured content (typically text) plays the most crucial role, due to the potential amount of extra knowledge it can deliver: to the best of our understanding, no efforts have been carried out to integrate an unstructured data extractor into the framework. For instance, given the Germany football team article, 8 we aim at extracting a set of meaningful facts and structure them in machine-readable statements. The sentence In Euro 1992, Germany reached the final, but lost 0–2 to Denmark would produce a list of triples, such as: (Germany, defeat, Denmark) (defeat, score, 0–2) (defeat, winner, Denmark) (defeat, competition, Euro 1992)";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "To fulfill both Wikidata and DBpedia duties, we aim at investigating in what extent can the Frame Semantics theory [16,17] be leveraged to perform Information Extraction over Web documents. The main purpose of Information Extraction is to gather structured data from free text via Natural Language Processing (NLP), while Frame Semantics originates from linguistic research in Artificial Intelligence. A frame can be informally defined as an event triggered by some term in a text and embedding a set of participants, or Frame Elements (FEs). Hence, the aforementioned sentence would induce the DEFEAT frame (triggered by lost) together with the WINNER, COMPETITION, and SCORE participants. Such theory has led to the creation of FRAME NET [5,6], namely a lexical database with manually annotated examples of frame usage in English. FrameNet currently adheres to a rigorous protocol for data annotation and quality control. The activity is known to be expensive with respect to time and cost, thus constituting an encumbrance for the extension of the resource [4], both in terms of additional labeled sentences and of languages. To alleviate this, crowdsourcing the annotation task is proven to dramatically reduce the financial and temporal expenses. Consequently, we foresee to exploit the novel annotation approach described in [18], which provides full frame annotation in a single step and in a bottom-up fashion, thus being also more compliant with the definition of frames as per [17].";

We cast this as a classification activity falling into the su- pervised learning paradigm. Specifically, we focus on the construction of a new extractor, to be integrated into the current DBpedia infrastructure. Frame Semantics will enable the discovery of relations that hold between entities in raw text. Its implementation takes as input a collection of documents from Wikipedia (i.e., the corpus) and outputs a structured dataset composed of machine-readable statements.";

To achieve this, we leverage the WIKI EXTRACTOR , 13 a third-party tool that retains the text and expands templates of a Wikipedia XML dump, while discarding other data such as tables, references, images, etc. We note that the tool is not completely robust with respect to templates expansion. Such drawback is expected for two reasons: first, new templates are constantly defined, thus requiring regular maintenance of the tool; second, Wikipedia editors do not always comply to the specifications of the templates they include. Therefore, we could not obtain a fully cleaned Wikipedia plain text corpus, and noticed gaps in its content, probably due to template expansion failures. Nevertheless, we argue that the loss of information is not significant and can be neglected despite the recall cost. From the entire Italian Wikipedia corpus, we slice the use case subset by querying the I TALIAN DBPEDIA CHAPTER 14 for the Wikipedia article IDs of relevant entities.";

Although our input has a relatively low dimension (i.e., 7.25 million tokens circa), we observe that the tool is not able to handle it as a whole, since it crashes with a segmentation fault even on a powerful machine (i.e., 24 cores CPU at 2.53 GHz, 64 GB RAM).

Two measures are combined to generate a score for each verb lemma, thus enabling the creation of a rank. We first compute the term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) of each verb lexicalization (i.e., the occurring tokens) over each document in the corpus: this weighting measure is intended to capture the lexi- cographical relevance of a given verb, namely how important it is with respect to other terms in the whole corpus. Then, we determine the standard deviation value out of the TF-IDF scores list: this statistical measure is meant to catch heterogeneously distributed verbs, in the sense that the higher the standard deviation is, the more variably the verb is used, thus helping to understand its overall usage signal over the corpus. Ultimately, we produce the final score and assign it to a verb lemma by averaging all its lexicalizations scores. The top-N lemmas serve as candidate LUs, each evoking one or more frames according to the definitions of a given frame repository.";

Moreover, we tried to provide a challenging model for the classification task, prioritizing FEs overlap among frames and LU ambiguity (i.e., focusing on very fine-grained semantics with subtle sense differences). We believe this does not only apply to machines, but also to humans: we can view it as a stress test both for the machine learning and the crowdsourcing parts.

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "Both frame and FEs recognition are cast to a multi- class classification task: while the former can be related to text categorization, the latter should answer questions such as can this entity be this FE? or is this entity this FE in this context?. Such activity boils down to semantic role labeling (cf. [24] for an introduction), and usually requires a more fine-grained text analysis. Previous work in the area exploits deeper NLP layers, such as syntactic parsing (e.g., [25]). We alleviate this through EL techniques, which perform word sense dis- ambiguation by linking relevant parts of a source sentence to URIs of a target KB. We leverage THE WIKI MACHINE 17 [19], a state-of-the-art [26] approach conceived for connecting text to Wikipedia URLs, thus inherently entailing DBpedia URIs. EL results are part of the FE classifier feature set. We claim that EL enables the automatic addition of features based on existing entity attributes within the target KB (notably, the class of an entity, which represents its semantic type).";

Moreover, asking the crowd to label such frequently occurring FEs would represent a considerable overhead, resulting in a higher temporal cost (i.e., more annotations per sentence) and lower overall annotation accuracy. Hence, we opted for the implementation of a rule-based system to detect and normalize numerical expressions. The normalization process takes as input a numerical expression such as a date, a duration, or a score, and outputs a transformation into a standard format suitable for later inclusion into the target KB.";

Therefore, we tackle this as per the following assumption: given the encyclopedic nature of our input corpus, both the logical and the topical subjects correspond in each document. Hence, each candidate sentence inherits the document subject.

In the FrameNet terminology, this is homologous to the assignment of semantic types to FEs: for instance, in the ACTIVITY frame, the AGENT is typed with the generic class Sentient. The idea would allow the implementation of the bottom-up one-step annotation flow described in [18]: to achieve this, we run EL over the input sentences and check whether the attached ontology class metadata appear in the frame repository, thus fulfilling the FE classification task.";

However, it overlaps with a temporal expression, thus confusing the classifier. AGENTE is often mistaken for ENTITÀ , due to their equivalent semantic type, which is always a person.

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "With respect to frames, we note that ATTIVITÀ is often mistaken for STATO or not classified at all: in fact, the difference between these two frames is quite subtle with respect to their sense. The former is more generic and could also be labeled as CAREER : if we viewed it in a frame hierarchy, it would serve as a superframe of the latter. The latter instead encodes the development modality of a soccer player’s career, e.g., when he remains unbound from some team due to contracting issues. Hence, we may conclude that distin- guishing between these frames is a challenge even for humans. Furthermore, frames with no FEs are classified as “O”, thus considered wrong despite the correct prediction. VITTORIA is almost never mistaken for TROFEO : this is positively surprising, since the FE COMPETIZIONE (frame VITTORIA) is often mistaken for PREMIO (frame TROFEO), but those FEs do not seem to affect the frame classification. Again, such FE distinction must take into account a delicate sense nuance, which is hard for humans as well. Due to an error in the training set crowdsourcing step, we lack of VITTORIA and PARTITA samples.";

We focus on the use case and argue that our approach will have a significant impact if we manage to identify non-existing properties. This would serve as a proof of concept which can ideally scale up to all kinds of input. In order to assess such potential impact in discovering new relations, we need to address the following question: which extractable relations are not already mapped in DBPO or do not even exist in the raw infobox properties datasets?. Table 4 illustrates an empirical lexicographical study gathered from the Italian Wikipedia soccer player subcorpus (circa 52,000 articles). It contains absolute occurrence frequencies of word stems (in descending order) that are likely to trigger domain-relevant frames, thus providing a rough overview of the extraction potential.";

On the other hand, the ontology properties have a more homogenous distribution compared to the raw ones: this serves as an expected proof of concept, since the main purpose of DBPO and the ontology mappings is to merge heterogenous and multilingual Wikipedia template attributes into a unique representation. In average, most raw properties are concentrated below coverage and frequency threshold values of 0.8 and 4 respectively: this means that roughly 80% of them have a significantly low usage, further highlighted by the log scale. While ontology properties are better distributed, most still do not reach a high coverage/frequency tradeoff, except for SoccerPlayer, which benefits from both rich data (cf. Section 3) and mappings. 28";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "First, we acknowledge that the use case frame repository is not exhaustive: LUs may have a higher ambiguity. For instance, giocare (to play) may trigger an additional frame depending on the context (as in the sentence to play as a defender); esordire (to start out) may also trigger the frame P ARTITA (match). Second, if a sentence is not in the gold standard, the supervised classifier should discard it (abstention). Third, the baseline approach may contain rules that are more harmful than beneficial, depending on the target KB reliability: for instance, the SportsEvent DBPO class leads to wrongly typed instances, due to the misuse of the template by Wikipedia editors. Finally, both the input corpus and the target KB originate from a relatively small Wikipedia chapter (i.e., Italian, with 1.23 million articles) if compared to the largest one (i.e., English, with almost 5 million articles). Therefore, we recognize that the T-Box and A-Box evaluation results may be proportionally different if obtained with English data.";

It is commonly argued that the main OIE drawback is the generation of noisy data [11,32], while RE is usually more accurate, but requires expensive supervision in terms of language resources [2,30,32].";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "RE traditionally takes as input a finite set R of relations and a document d, and induces assertions in the form rel(subj, obj), where rel represent binary relations between a subject entity subj and an object entity obj mentioned in d. Hence, it may be viewed as a closed-domain paradigm. Recent efforts [3,2,30] have focused on alleviating the cost of full supervision via distant supervision. Distant supervision leverages available KBs to automatically annotate training data in the input documents. This is in contrast to our work, since we aim at enriching the target KB with external data, rather than using it as a source. Furthermore, our relatively cheap crowdsourcing technique serves as a substitute to distant supervision, while ensuring full supervision. Other approaches such as [7,33] instead leverage text that is not covered by the target KB, like we do.";

To tackle the issue, [12] propose a framework that clusters OIE facts and maps them to elements of a target KB. Similarly to us, they leverage EL techniques for disambiguation and choose DBpedia as the target KB. Nevertheless, the authors focus on A-Box population, while we also cater for the T-Box part. Moreover, OIE systems are used as a black boxes, in contrast to our full implementation of the extraction pipeline. Finally, relations are still binary, instead of our n-ary ones. Taking as input Wikipedia articles, L EGALO [28] exploits page links manually inserted by editors and attempts to induce the relations between them via NLP. Again, the extracted relations are binary and are not mapped to a target KB for enrichment purposes.";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "In this article, we presented a system that puts into practice our fourfold research contribution: first, we perform (1) N-ary relation extraction thanks to the implementation of Frame Semantics, in contrast to traditional binary approaches; second, we (2) jointly enrich both the T-Box and the A-Box parts of our target KB, through the discovery of candidate relations and the extraction of facts respectively. We achieve this with a (3) shallow layer of NLP technology only, namely grammatical analysis, instead of more sophisticated ones, such as syntactic parsing. Finally, we ensure a (4) fully supervised learning paradigm via an affordable crowdsourcing methodology. Our work concurrently bears the advantages and leaves out the weaknesses of RE and OIE: although we assess it in a closed-domain fashion via a use case (Section 3), the corpus analysis module (Section 5) allows to discover an exhaustive set of relations in an open-domain way. In addition, we overcome the supervision cost bottleneck trough crowdsourcing. Therefore, we believe our approach can represent a trade-off between open-domain high noise and closed-domain high cost.";

The community is currently concerned by the trustworthiness of Wikidata assertions: in order to authenticate them, they should be validated against references to external Web sources. Under this perspective, the FACT EXTRACTOR can serve as a reference suggestion mechanism for statement validation. To achieve this, we have successfully managed to switch the input corpus from Wikipedia to third-party corpora and translated our output to fit the Wikidata data model. The soccer use case has already been partially implemented: we have ran the baseline classifier and generated a small demonstra- tive dataset, named FBK-STREPHIT-SOCCER, which has been uploaded to the primary sources tool back-end.

    linkflows:hasCommentText "This article presents work on \"N-ary Relation Extraction for Joint T-Box and A-Box Knowledge Base Augmentation\". The authors propose the FactExtractor system, i.e., a workflow that runs unstructured natural language text through an NLP pipeline in order to generate machine-readable statements that can be used to extend an existing knowledge base. Their approach capitalizes on Frame Semantics as a theoretical backbone from linguistic theory that serves as an interface between an ontology or data model and natural language. The authors demonstrate the capabilities of FactExtractor in a use case based on Italian Wikipedia text (snapshot of 52.000 articles about soccer players) and DBpedia as the target knowledge base to be enriched. The mapping between the DBPO data model and the natural language extractions is achieved by manually defined frames, which provide event classes and expressive roles partipating in these events, both of which can be readily transformed into RDF statements in order to populate the KB. For the given use case, the authors had to define a total of six frames and 15 roles which are particularly tailored to the domain at hand. As such, the proposed method provides an interesting complement to KB population from semi-structured sources such as Wikipedia infoboxes that is commonly used approach in the DBpedia community. Therefore, and due to its novel linguistic underpinnings, I consider this work highly original.";

Certainly, FactExtractor is capable of populating both T-Box and A-Box _simultaneously_, i.e., relying on one and the same pipeline of analyis. However, I cannot see any aspect in the system that indicates a genuinely _joint_ approach in the sense that T-Box and A-Box knowledge acquisition is closely intertwined in order to exploit mutual dependencies between the two (which would correspond to the common use of the term in the machine learning or NLP literature). I would suggest to change the terminology here.";

First, for the sake of exactness and replicability of the results, this threshold should be explicitly stated. Second, I am a bit concerned that this strategy might introduce a bias towards shorter sentence with a relatively simple syntactic structure, which might explain why Named Entity Linking serves well as a surrogate of syntactic parsing. If so, this clearly questions the scalability of the approach. In any case, I would like to see a more comprehensive discussion of these aspects.";

    linkflows:hasCommentText "The representation of generated statements should be better clarified. In fact, in Section 2 they authors provide an example that does not reflect the semantics provided by the example in Section 9 (page 10). Namely, in the first example the authors state that, from the sentence \"In Euro 1992, Germany reached the final, but lost 0-2 to Denmark\", the pipeline generates: * a new statement \"Germany defeat Denmark\" where defeat is the frame * a set of facts about the new property by using FEs. Instead, in the second example, for the same sentence, the pipeline generates * a new statement \":Germany defeat :Defeat01\" * a set of facts about the object :Defeat01 The semantics of the first example leds to extensional issues when adding new facts to a property/frame. This issues seem to be resolved by the second example. However, the statement is completely different as no explicit binary relation is generated between Germany and Denmark. Rather, a more coherent (with respect to first example) and correct formalisation could be the following: :Germany :defeat_01 :Denmark . :defeat_01 rdfs:subPropertyOf :defeat . :defeat_01 :winner :Denmark ; :loser :Germany ; :competition :Euro_1992 ; :score \"0-2\" .";

  sub:abstract c4o:hasContent "The contextual information in the built environment is highly heterogeneous, it goes from static information (e.g., information about the building structure) to dynamic information (e.g., user’s space-time information, sensors detections and events that occurred). This paper proposes to semantically fuse the building contextual information with data coming from a smart camera network by using ontologies and semantic web technologies. The ontology developed allows interoperability between the different contextual data and enables, without human interaction, real-time event detections to be performed and system reconfigurations. The use of semantic knowledge in multi-camera monitoring systems guarantees the protection of the user’s privacy by not sending nor saving any image, just extracting the knowledge from them. This paper presents a new approach to develop a \"all-seeing\" smart building, where the global system is the first step to attempt to provide Artificial Intelligence (AI) to a building. More details of the system and future works can be found at the following website: http://wisenet.checksem.fr/ .";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "In Greek mythology, Argus Panoptes was a giant with a hundred eyes. It was impossible to deceive his vigilance, for only some of his eyes slept while the rest were awake. Argus was the servant of Hera. At his death, Hera rewarded the giant’s fidelity by trans- ferring his eyes to the feathers of the peacock, his favorite animal. \"To have the eyes of Argus\" is a popular expression which means to be lucid and vigilant. The term Panoptes means \"all-seeing\". Within the built en- vironment the term \"all-seeing\" is a quest in terms of access control, flow control and activities. In that context, a Panoptes building would characterize a smart building equipped with a network of cameras which could, in real-time, combine the different information seen and deduce the triggering of actions. In classical multi-camera based systems there is a monitor room with a central processing server where all the information is collected and analyzed in real-time by a human operator (or a set of them). However, as the size of the network increases, it becomes more difficult (or even impossible) for the human operator to monitor all the video streams at the same time and to identify events. Furthermore, having a large amount of infor- mation makes it infeasible to create a relation between actions that happened in the past and current actions.";

The creation of a Panoptes building is a complicate task due to the integration of data coming from different domains around the knowledge of the building composition. Many works have been done using semantic web standards such as Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Web Ontology Language (OWL) to represent contextual data [16]. On those systems, the ontology plays a crucial role in enabling the processing and sharing of information and knowledge, i.e., the use of an ontology allows interoperability between different domains.";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "This paper proposes an ontology for a Panoptes building that repurposes and integrates information about different domains composing the built context. The proposed ontology is the kernel of the WiseNET (Wise NETwork) system, which is a context-aware system whose main function is to perform reasoning about heterogeneous sources of information. Explicitly, the WiseNET system enhances the information of a smart camera network (SCN) with contextual information to allow autonomously real-time event/anomalies detection and system reconfiguration. The main contribution of this paper is the semantic fusion of Industry Foundations Classes (IFC) data with sensor information and other domain information in the Panoptes context, by using semantic web technologies. A semantic-based system is presented as well, which allows to overcome the multi-camera based system limitations and some computer vision problems, specially the privacy protection which nowadays is an important factor to consider..";

Specifically, we wanted to know: can (i) we enhance the results of the LD quality issue de- tection through lay users by adding a subsequent step of cross-checking (Verify) to the initial Find stage? Or is it (ii) even more promising to combine experts and lay workers by letting the latter Verify the results of the experts’ Find step, hence drawing on the crowds’ complementary skills for deficiency identification we recognized before?”";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "Most of the previous applications use a SCN de-ployed in a built environment to obtain and analyze different type of information. Therefore, they might be considered as Panoptes building applications. The main function of a Panoptes building is to combine the different information obtained by the SCN and to deduce the triggering of actions/events in real-time. In that context, Panoptes building applications should un- derstand the static building information as well as perceive (accurately) the dynamic and evolving data, i.e., they should be aware of their context. A context-aware system in the built environment is a complex task; it requires information from different domains such as environment data, sensing devices, spatio-temporal facts and details about the different events that may occur. For example, the required event information could be a set of concepts and relations concerning the different events that may occur in a built environment, their location, the time they occurred, the agents involved, the relation to other events and their consequences. In the case of the sensor information, the required data could be the description of the different sensing devices, the process implemented on them and their results. Regarding the environment, the required data could be the structure of the building, its topology and the different elements contained in a space.";

Dibley et al. developed an ontology framework that combines a sensor ontology with a building ontology and others supporting ontologies [10]. Other works have focused on using ontologies for combining computer vision with different kinds of information such as SanMiguel et al. which created an ontology composed mainly of knowledge about objects, events and image processing algorithms [34]; Chaochaisit et al. presented a semantic connection between sensor specification, localization methods and contextual in- formation [5]; and Town which presented an ontology that fusion multiple computer vision stages with con- text information for image retrieval and event detections [39].

The most no- table applications for the DLs is to provide the logical formalism for ontologies languages such as OWL. OWL-2, the current W3C ontology language recom-mendation, is based on the expressive description logic SROIQ(D) [17]. SROIQ(D) extends the well known description logic SHOIN (D) by including: a role constructor by general inclusion (R) and a qualified number restriction (Q). SROIQ(D) provides high expressive power with high computational cost of reasoning. Hence, to meet a more suitable compromise between the expressive power and the computational cost, the WiseNET ontology was defined using the SHOIQ(D) language which is more expressive than SHOIN (D) yet less expressive than SROIQ(D) and less computational complex [22]. A definition of the SHOIQ(D) constructors and some examples referencing the WiseNET ontology can be found in the Table 5.";

WiseNET is a semantic-based system that fuses heterogeneous sources of data such as data coming from sensors and the different contextual information. Due to the application of the paper (Panoptes building), we will focus in a specific type of sensor: smart cameras; however, the system is defined to include other type of sensors such as temperature, humidity, depth sensor, etc. The main goal of WiseNET is to improve classical computer vision and deep learning systems by considering the contextual information of the environment and by performing real-time reasoning. As a result, WiseNET may overcome some limitations of computer vision (e.g., false detections and missed detections), some drawbacks of deep learning (e.g., the need of large amount of training and test- ing data) and limitations of multi-camera based system (presented in Section 1) while allowing real-time event/anomalies detection and system reconfiguration.";

sub:assertion {
  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "Figure 2 illustrates the architecture of the WiseNET system. The system is articulated in three sections: the smart camera network, the central unit and the monitor unit. The SCN is a set of smart cameras distributed in an environment. The main functions of the SCN, in the WiseNET system, is to extract low-level features from a scene (such as person detection as shown in blue and green in the right side of the Figure 2), to convert the extracted data into knowledge and then to send it to the central unit. More information regarding the type of smart cameras used can be found in [23]. The central unit is composed of two elements the central API and the WiseNET ontology. The central API is in charge of the management of the ontology, for example: capturing the knowledge coming from the SCN and insert it to the ontology, retrieving inferred knowledge from the ontology, transferring data to the monitor unit, sending new configurations to the smart cameras, and other services. The WiseNET ontology is responsible of enabling interoperability between the incoming knowledge streams and the contextual data (e.g., environment information, previous knowledge and sensor in- formation) in order to deduce new knowledge and detect events/anomalies based on the history of activities. The central unit is also in charge of re-identifying people in the system by using their visual features extracted by the SCN. Eventually, the central unit could request extra information to the SCN. The monitor unit has as main function the visualization of the static and dynamic information; this unit will automatically retrieve information and will present it in a graphical manner, for example an occupancy map (as shown at the center of Figure 2). The monitor unit implements some queries to answer questions such as: how many people is in a room? what is the location of a person? and many others (see Table 1).";

Our system differs from other computer vision systems mainly by three factors. First, no images are sent, the smart cameras extract the knowledge from the images and then this knowledge is sent to the central unit (for more details see Section 6.1). Second, the WiseNET system combines context information with the camera information to improve the detections, in this way, it can overcome missed detections or non-detectable in- formation (e.g., people out of sight of a camera). Third, the system uses an ontology to fusion the different kinds of information presented in a Panoptes building, such as: information of the environment, time, smart cameras, events, detectable objects, etc.";

		cameraID: \"Camera_5\",
		ImageAlgorithm: \"Person Detection\",
		RegionOfInterest: \"Roi_5\",
		xywh: \"107,20,30,50\",
		visualDescriptors: \"29,31,45\",
		where all the variables corresponds to terms defined in the WiseNET ontology (see Tables 3 and 4). The xywh are the coordinates of the detection box (green bounding box in Figure 2). The visual descriptors of the detection box were obtained by using the RGB histogram method. This is a classic image processing method that consist on taking the most preeminent color tone for each channel (R (red), G (green), B (blue)). It is possible to use different visual descriptors such as different color space or even physical characteristics (e.g., height, head size and shoulder width) [4]. After describing the scene, the smart camera sends that knowledge to the central unit by using web services. Moreover, when a person is detected an instant event is created. An instant event is a type of event that occurs in an specific point in time/space. If it is the first time a person is detected in a specific space, then the event ’person in space’ is also created. This is an interval event and, as its name indicates, it occurs in a time interval (i.e., it has a starting and an end time). The ’person in space’ event is an array containing the detections of a person in an specific space. Finally, the central API will dynamically insert this knowledge into the ontology. The central API has many functions such as performing the statics and dynamic population and managing the system reconfiguration. Currently, the reconfiguration task is in development process.""";

However, the central API is in development process, therefore it is not possible to perform an evaluation of the complete system. Moreover, the WiseNET ontology may be evaluated. According to Hitzler et al. the accuracy criteria is a central requirement for ontology evaluation [14]. This criteria consists on verifying if the ontology accurately captures the aspects of the modeled domain for which it has designed for. The WiseNET ontology development was based on some competency questions (see Table 1), therefore the evaluation consists on showing that those questions can be answered by the ontology. Listing 6 presents the queries to answer some competency questions. Those questions were selected because they involve aspects which are important in a Panoptes building such as: knowing how many spaces there are in the storeys, which doors a smart camera monitors, how many people are in a space, at what time a person enter/leave a space and how much time a person stayed on a space. Question 1 (of Listing 6) was answered by getting all the elements aggregated by the building storeys. For answering question 2, the regions of interest (ROIs) in a camera’s field of view and their physical representation are obtained. Question 3 was answered by counting the number of ’person in space’ events in the specific space. Question 4 and 5 were answered by using the time interval entity of the event ’person in space’. The time interval entity has a be- ginning, end and duration (the duration is giving in a temporal unit).";

Also, two types of populations in the Panoptes environment were defined, static and dynamic. Furthermore, we believe that a classification of smart building should be done due to the generality of the actual definition of smart building. This classification may be created by considering: the functionalities of the smart building, the devices utilize, or a combination of both. The third type of classification was applied by defining a Panoptes building as a smart building using only cameras and focusing in monitoring the activities of people. Moreover, we considered that applications concerning smart buildings should exploit the built environment information, specially the data obtained from the IFC. We also proposed to enhance the IFC information by adding functional facts to the spaces and information about the security systems in the built environment.";

In general, the ontologies are not designed to be used in that way, therefore a central API is needed to be designed to perform two main tasks. Firstly, to receive all the messages from the SCN, synchronize them (by using timestamps) and then populate the ontology. Secondly, to check the ontology inferred knowledge and to use it for reconfigure the SCN by triggering a specific action (e.g., recording and triggering an alarm), changing the image pro- cessing algorithm or by saying to the smart camera to focus on a specific ROI.

The purpose of the developed ontology is to create a kernel of a Panoptes building system (i.e., the WiseNET system), rather than working towards publishing another generic ontology. The ontology development procedure was performed using different semantic technologies, and it consisted of: defining a set of questions that the ontology should answer (competency questions); reusing different domain on- tologies (DUL, event, ifcowl, person and ssn); creating a set of classes and properties to connect the different domain ontologies and to complete the application knowledge; defining a set of constrains and extending the expressiveness by using logic rules; and finally, populating the ontology with static information (built environment and smart camera setup) and dynamic information (smart camera detections).";

A future goal of the WiseNET system is to offer services to building users according to information coming from a network of sensors deployed on the built environment and contextual information.

  sub:abstract c4o:hasContent "The contextual information in the built environment is highly heterogeneous, it goes from static information (e.g., information about the building structure) to dynamic information (e.g., user’s space-time information, sensors detections and events that occurred). This paper proposes to semantically fuse the building contextual information with data coming from a smart camera network by using ontologies and semantic web technologies. The ontology developed allows interoperability between the different contextual data and enables, without human interaction, real-time event detections to be performed and system reconfigurations. The use of semantic knowledge in multi-camera monitoring systems guarantees the protection of the user’s privacy by not sending nor saving any image, just extracting the knowledge from them. This paper presents a new approach to develop a \"all-seeing\" smart building, where the global system is the first step to attempt to provide Artificial Intelligence (AI) to a building. More details of the system and future works can be found at the following website: http://wisenet.checksem.fr/ .";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "In Greek mythology, Argus Panoptes was a giant with a hundred eyes. It was impossible to deceive his vigilance, for only some of his eyes slept while the rest were awake. Argus was the servant of Hera. At his death, Hera rewarded the giant’s fidelity by trans- ferring his eyes to the feathers of the peacock, his favorite animal. \"To have the eyes of Argus\" is a popular expression which means to be lucid and vigilant. The term Panoptes means \"all-seeing\". Within the built en- vironment the term \"all-seeing\" is a quest in terms of access control, flow control and activities. In that context, a Panoptes building would characterize a smart building equipped with a network of cameras which could, in real-time, combine the different information seen and deduce the triggering of actions. In classical multi-camera based systems there is a monitor room with a central processing server where all the information is collected and analyzed in real-time by a human operator (or a set of them). However, as the size of the network increases, it becomes more difficult (or even impossible) for the human operator to monitor all the video streams at the same time and to identify events. Furthermore, having a large amount of infor- mation makes it infeasible to create a relation between actions that happened in the past and current actions.";

The creation of a Panoptes building is a complicate task due to the integration of data coming from different domains around the knowledge of the building composition. Many works have been done using semantic web standards such as Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Web Ontology Language (OWL) to represent contextual data [16].

Explicitly, the WiseNET system enhances the information of a smart camera network (SCN) with contextual information to allow autonomously real-time event/anomalies detection and system reconfiguration. The main contribution of this paper is the semantic fusion of Industry Foundations Classes (IFC) data with sensor information and other domain information in the Panoptes context, by using semantic web technologies. A semantic-based system is presented as well, which allows to overcome the multi-camera based system limitations and some computer vision problems, specially the privacy protection which nowadays is an important factor to consider..";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "Most of the previous applications use a SCN de-ployed in a built environment to obtain and analyze different type of information. Therefore, they might be considered as Panoptes building applications. The main function of a Panoptes building is to combine the different information obtained by the SCN and to deduce the triggering of actions/events in real-time. In that context, Panoptes building applications should un- derstand the static building information as well as perceive (accurately) the dynamic and evolving data, i.e., they should be aware of their context. A context-aware system in the built environment is a complex task; it requires information from different domains such as environment data, sensing devices, spatio-temporal facts and details about the different events that may occur. For example, the required event information could be a set of concepts and relations concerning the different events that may occur in a built environment, their location, the time they occurred, the agents involved, the relation to other events and their consequences. In the case of the sensor information, the required data could be the description of the different sensing devices, the process implemented on them and their results. Regarding the environment, the required data could be the structure of the building, its topology and the different elements contained in a space.";

BIM becomes a general term designing the set of numerical data, objects and processes appended during the life-cycle of a building [11]. From the designing, construction and facility management steps, the BIM allows practitioners and managers to exchange data in a uniform way using the IFC standard [40]. The IFC standard gives the base of description, both semantic and graphic of all elements making the building [20]. This allows to aggregate all heterogeneous software dedicated to the built environment on an interoperability way. In the domain of interoperability three levels are described: technical, organizational and semantics [21]. The IFC aims the technical interoperability level [9]. The organizational level is in charge of the practitioners according to the law of each country and the rules of each enterprise. The semantics level aims to clearly specify the meaning of each element making the BIM.";

There have being many works that combine semantic information coming from different sources in an ontology. Hong et al. presented some context-aware systems were the ontology plays a central role for enabling interoperability between devices and agents which are not designed to work together [16]. Dibley et al. developed an ontology framework that combines a sensor ontology with a building ontology and others supporting ontologies [10]. Other works have focused on using ontologies for combining computer vision with different kinds of information such as SanMiguel et al. which created an ontology composed mainly of knowledge about objects, events and image processing algorithms [34]; Chaochaisit et al. presented a semantic connection between sensor specification, localization methods and contextual in- formation [5]; and Town which presented an ontology that fusion multiple computer vision stages with con- text information for image retrieval and event detections [39]. The use of ontologies as an interoperability agent warranties the information fusion. Consequently, we propose the creation of an ontology to combine and re-purpose the different types of information required by a Panoptes building.";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "Description logics (DLs) are a family of formalism for representing knowledge [1]. The most no- table applications for the DLs is to provide the logical formalism for ontologies languages such as OWL. OWL-2, the current W3C ontology language recom-mendation, is based on the expressive description logic SROIQ(D) [17]. SROIQ(D) extends the well known description logic SHOIN (D) by including: a role constructor by general inclusion (R) and a qualified number restriction (Q). SROIQ(D) provides high expressive power with high computational cost of reasoning. Hence, to meet a more suitable compromise between the expressive power and the computational cost, the WiseNET ontology was defined using the SHOIQ(D) language which is more expressive than SHOIN (D) yet less expressive than SROIQ(D) and less computational complex [22]. A definition of the SHOIQ(D) constructors and some examples referencing the WiseNET ontology can be found in the Table 5.";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "Figure 2 illustrates the architecture of the WiseNET system. The system is articulated in three sections: the smart camera network, the central unit and the monitor unit. The SCN is a set of smart cameras distributed in an environment. The main functions of the SCN, in the WiseNET system, is to extract low-level features from a scene (such as person detection as shown in blue and green in the right side of the Figure 2), to convert the extracted data into knowledge and then to send it to the central unit. More information regarding the type of smart cameras used can be found in [23]. The central unit is composed of two elements the central API and the WiseNET ontology. The central API is in charge of the management of the ontology, for example: capturing the knowledge coming from the SCN and insert it to the ontology, retrieving inferred knowledge from the ontology, transferring data to the monitor unit, sending new configurations to the smart cameras, and other services. The WiseNET ontology is responsible of enabling interoperability between the incoming knowledge streams and the contextual data (e.g., environment information, previous knowledge and sensor in- formation) in order to deduce new knowledge and detect events/anomalies based on the history of activities. The central unit is also in charge of re-identifying people in the system by using their visual features extracted by the SCN. Eventually, the central unit could request extra information to the SCN. The monitor unit has as main function the visualization of the static and dynamic information; this unit will automatically retrieve information and will present it in a graphical manner, for example an occupancy map (as shown at the center of Figure 2). The monitor unit implements some queries to answer questions such as: how many people is in a room? what is the location of a person? and many others (see Table 1).";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "The proposed system is context-aware and combines the information extracted by the SCN with logic rules and knowledge of what the camera observes, building information and events that may occurred. Our system differs from other computer vision systems mainly by three factors. First, no images are sent, the smart cameras extract the knowledge from the images and then this knowledge is sent to the central unit (for more details see Section 6.1). Second, the WiseNET system combines context information with the camera information to improve the detections, in this way, it can overcome missed detections or non-detectable in- formation (e.g., people out of sight of a camera). Third, the system uses an ontology to fusion the different kinds of information presented in a Panoptes building, such as: information of the environment, time, smart cameras, events, detectable objects, etc.";

This step can be seen as a soft camera calibration that requires only the location of the cameras in the building. This differs from many multi-camera based systems, that required overlapping between the fields of views of the cameras and their orientation, leading to a time-consuming and skill-dependent calibration process [36]. An important contribution of using an ontology during the smart camera setup is the automatic suggestion of pertinent elements according to the space. This is achieved by using the static population of the building information.";

		cameraID: \"Camera_5\",
		ImageAlgorithm: \"Person Detection\",
		RegionOfInterest: \"Roi_5\",
		xywh: \"107,20,30,50\",
		visualDescriptors: \"29,31,45\",
		where all the variables corresponds to terms defined in the WiseNET ontology (see Tables 3 and 4). The xywh are the coordinates of the detection box (green bounding box in Figure 2). The visual descriptors of the detection box were obtained by using the RGB histogram method. This is a classic image processing method that consist on taking the most preeminent color tone for each channel (R (red), G (green), B (blue)). It is possible to use different visual descriptors such as different color space or even physical characteristics (e.g., height, head size and shoulder width) [4]. After describing the scene, the smart camera sends that knowledge to the central unit by using web services. Moreover, when a person is detected an instant event is created. An instant event is a type of event that occurs in an specific point in time/space. If it is the first time a person is detected in a specific space, then the event ’person in space’ is also created. This is an interval event and, as its name indicates, it occurs in a time interval (i.e., it has a starting and an end time). The ’person in space’ event is an array containing the detections of a person in an specific space. Finally, the central API will dynamically insert this knowledge into the ontology. The central API has many functions such as performing the statics and dynamic population and managing the system reconfiguration. Currently, the reconfiguration task is in development process.""";

However, the central API is in development process, therefore it is not possible to perform an evaluation of the complete system. Moreover, the WiseNET ontology may be evaluated. According to Hitzler et al. the accuracy criteria is a central requirement for ontology evaluation [14]. This criteria consists on verifying if the ontology accurately captures the aspects of the modeled domain for which it has designed for. The WiseNET ontology development was based on some competency questions (see Table 1), therefore the evaluation consists on showing that those questions can be answered by the ontology. Listing 6 presents the queries to answer some competency questions. Those questions were selected because they involve aspects which are important in a Panoptes building such as: knowing how many spaces there are in the storeys, which doors a smart camera monitors, how many people are in a space, at what time a person enter/leave a space and how much time a person stayed on a space. Question 1 (of Listing 6) was answered by getting all the elements aggregated by the building storeys. For answering question 2, the regions of interest (ROIs) in a camera’s field of view and their physical representation are obtained. Question 3 was answered by counting the number of ’person in space’ events in the specific space. Question 4 and 5 were answered by using the time interval entity of the event ’person in space’. The time interval entity has a be- ginning, end and duration (the duration is giving in a temporal unit).";

Furthermore, we believe that a classification of smart building should be done due to the generality of the actual definition of smart building. This classification may be created by considering: the functionalities of the smart building, the devices utilize, or a combination of both. The third type of classification was applied by defining a Panoptes building as a smart building using only cameras and focusing in monitoring the activities of people. Moreover, we considered that applications concerning smart buildings should exploit the built environment information, specially the data obtained from the IFC.

First of all, the WiseNET system does not needs training and testing data like the other systems. Secondly, by sending only the extracted knowledge of the image the amount of data transmitted through the network is lower than the other systems. Furthermore, a semantic-based system allow us to efficiently fusion different type of information (as shown in this paper), specially environmental information, which gives advantages over other type of systems. Those and other advantages will be studied in future work.";

The bi-directionality between the SCN and the central unit is a novelty in the semantic web domain. Specifically, the mechanism of using the ontology to interact with external devices. In general, the ontologies are not designed to be used in that way, therefore a central API is needed to be designed to perform two main tasks. Firstly, to receive all the messages from the SCN, synchronize them (by using timestamps) and then populate the ontology. Secondly, to check the ontology inferred knowledge and to use it for reconfigure the SCN by triggering a specific action (e.g., recording and triggering an alarm), changing the image pro- cessing algorithm or by saying to the smart camera to focus on a specific ROI. The dependency on the central API leaves an open question about the automatic externalization of the ontology knowledge, i.e., making the ontology to automatically output the inferred knowledge.";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "According to the legend of Argus we tried to develop a \"all-seeing\" smart building, which we have called Panoptes building. With that motivation, the WiseNET ontology was developed. Its main goal is to fusions the different built environment contextual information with information coming from the smart camera network and other domain information, to allow real-time event detections and system reconfiguration. The purpose of the developed ontology is to create a kernel of a Panoptes building system (i.e., the WiseNET system), rather than working towards publishing another generic ontology. The ontology development procedure was performed using different semantic technologies, and it consisted of: defining a set of questions that the ontology should answer (competency questions); reusing different domain on- tologies (DUL, event, ifcowl, person and ssn); creating a set of classes and properties to connect the different domain ontologies and to complete the application knowledge; defining a set of constrains and extending the expressiveness by using logic rules; and finally, populating the ontology with static information (built environment and smart camera setup) and dynamic information (smart camera detections).";

  sub:paragraph c4o:hasContent "The WiseNET system is a semantic-based real-time reasoning system, that fuses different sources of data and is expected to overcomes limitations of multi-camera based system. The WiseNET system selects relevant information from the video streams and adds contextual information to overcome problems of miss- ing information due to false/missed detections. Ad- ditionally, it relates events that occurred at different times, without human interaction. It also protects the user’s privacy by not sending nor saving any image, just extracting the knowledge from them. It may as well, reconfigure the smart camera network according to the inferred knowledge. In few words, the WiseNET system enables interoperability of information from different domains such as the built environment, event information and information coming from the smart camera network. A future goal of the WiseNET system is to offer services to building users according to information coming from a network of sensors deployed on the built environment and contextual information. This is a highly complex task due to the large scope of the building system, that goes from the static physical structure of the built environment to the internal envi- ronment in terms of the dynamic building users and the way how they interact with the building facilities.";

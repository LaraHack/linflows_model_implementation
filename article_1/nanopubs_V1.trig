We base our approach on the analysis of the most common errors encountered in Linked Data sources, and a classification of these errors according to the extent to which they are likely to be amenable to crowdsourcing. We then propose and compare different crowdsourcing approaches to identify these Linked Data quality issues, employing the DBpedia dataset as our use case: (i) a contest targeting the Linked Data expert community, and (ii) paid microtasks published on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We secondly focus on adapting the Find-Fix-Verify crowdsourcing pattern to exploit the strengths of experts and lay workers. By testing two distinct Find-Verify workflows (lay users only and experts verified by lay users) we reveal how to best combine different crowds’ complementary aptitudes in quality issue detection. The results show that a combination of the two styles of crowdsourcing is likely to achieve more efficient results than each of them used in isolation, and that human computation is a promising and affordable way to enhance the quality of Linked Data.""" .

This is the result of a combination of data- and process- related factors. The data sets being released into the LOD Cloud are – apart from any factual flaws they may contain – very diverse in terms of formats, struc- ture, and vocabulary.

		c4o:hasContent """Crowdsourcing [19] refers to the process of solving a problem formulated as a task by reaching out to a large network of (often previously unknown) people. One of the most popular forms of crowdsourcing are ‘microtasks’ (or ‘microwork’), which consists on di- viding a task into several smaller subtasks that can be independently solved. Conditional on the tackled prob- lem, the level of task granularity can vary (microtasks whose results need to be aggregated vs. macrotasks, which require filtering to identify the most valuable contributions); as can the incentive structure (e.g., pay- ments per unit of useful work vs. prizes for top par- ticipants in a contest). Another major design decision in the crowdsourcing workflow is the selection of the crowd. While many (micro)tasks can be performed by untrained workers, others might require more skilled human participants, especially in specialized fields of expertise, such as LD. Of course, expert intervention usually comes at a higher price; either in monetary re- wards or in the form of effort to recruit participants in another setting, such as volunteer work. Microtask crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) 1 on the other hand offer a formidable and readily-available workforce at relatively low fees.""" .

We did so building on previous work of ours [43] which analyzed common quality prob- lems encountered in Linked Data sources and classi- fied them according to the extent to which they could be amenable to crowdsourcing. The first research ques- tion explored is hence: RQ1: Is it feasible to detect quality issues in LD sets via crowdsourcing mecha- nisms? This question aims at establishing a general un- derstanding if crowdsourcing approaches can be used to find issues in LD sets and if so, to what degree they are an efficient and effective solution. Secondly, given the option of different crowds, we formulate RQ2: In a crowdsourcing approach, can we employ unskilled lay users to identify quality issues in RDF triple data or to what extent is expert validation needed and desirable? As a subquestion to RQ2, we also examined which type of crowd is most suitable to detect which type of quality issue (and, conversely, which errors they are prone to make). With these questions, we are interested (i) in learning to what extent we can exploit the cost- efficiency of lay users, or if the quality of error detec- tion is prohibitively low. We (ii) investigate how well experts generally perform in a crowdsourcing setting and if and how they outperform lay users. And lastly, (iii) it is of interest if one of the two distinct approaches performs well in areas that might not be a strength of the other method and crowd.""" .

The task consisted solely of the rating of a formerly indicated quality is- sue for a triple as correctly or wrongly assigned. This Verify step was, in fact, able to improve the preci- sion of both Find stages substantially. In particular, the experts’ Find stage results could be improved to precision levels of around 0.9 in the Verify stage for two error types which showed to score much lower for an expert-only Find approach. The worker-worker Find-Verify strategy yielded also better results than the Find-only worker approach, and for one error type even reached slightly better precision than the expert-worker model.

In our previous work [44], we compiled a list of data quality dimensions (criteria) applica- ble to Linked Data quality assessment. Afterwards, we mapped these dimensions to DBpedia [43]. A sub-set of four dimensions of the original framework were found particularly relevant in this setting: Ac- curacy, Relevancy, Representational-Consistency and Interlinking. To provide a comprehensive analysis of DBpedia quality, we further divided these four cate- gories of problems into sub-categories.

The idea, originating from open innovation, has been employed in many domains, from creative industries to sciences, for tasks of varying complexity (from designing logos to building sophisticated algorithms). In particular, contests as means to successfully involve experts in advancing science have a long-standing tradition in research, e.g., the Darpa challenges 3 and NetFlix. 4 Usually, contests as crowdsourcing mechanisms are open for a medium to long period of time in order to attract high quality contributions. Contests may apply different reward models, but a common modality is to define one main prize for the contest winner.""" .

The second workflow entirely relies on microtask crowdsourcing to perform the Find and Verify stages. As discussed in Section 3, these crowdsourcing approaches exhibit different characteristics in terms of the types of tasks they can be applied to, the way the results are consolidated and exploited, and the audiences they target. Therefore, in this work we study the impact on involving different types of crowd to detect quality issues in RDF triples: LD experts in the contest and workers in the microtasks.

In addition, a parameter α can be specified as a threshold on the number of questions to include in a single microtask. Algorithm 1 presents the procedure to create the microtasks. The algorithm firstly per- forms a pruning step (line 2) to remove triples that do not require human assessment. For instance, in our im- plementation, the function prune discards RDF triples whose URIs could not be dereferenced. The algorithm then proceeds to build microtasks such that each microtask only contains triples associated with a specific resource, similar to the interfaces of the TripleCheck-Mate tool used in the contest. The set S contains all the resources that appear as subjects in the set of triples T (line 3). For each subject, the algorithm builds the set of triples T 0 associated with the subject (line 5), and the creation of microtasks begins (line 6). From the pool T 0 , a triple t is selected (line 8) and the corresponding human-readable information is extracted (line 9). In this stage, similar to the TripleCheckMate, each microtask requires the workers to browse all the possible quality issues, therefore, the set of issues to assess on triple t is equal to Q in each microtask cre- ated (line 10). In case that the number of questions in the current microtask exceeds the threshold α, a new microtask is then created. The definition of the parameter α allows for avoiding the creation of very long tasks, i.e., when the number of triples with the same subject is large; appropriate values of α enables the creation of tasks than can still be solved in a reasonable time, consistent with the concept of microtask (a short task). Algorithm 1 continues creating microtasks for all the triples of a resource (lines 7-16), for all the resources (lines 4-18). The outcome of the algorithm is a set M of microtasks to assess the quality of the triples in T according to the issues in Q.""" .

		c4o:hasContent """An important aspect when generating microtasks from RDF data (or machine-readable data in general) is developing useful human-understandable interfaces (Algorithm 1, line 9) for the target non-expert crowds. In microtasks, optimal user interfaces reduce ambigu- ity as well as the probability to retrieve erroneous answers from the crowd due to a misinterpretation of the task. Therefore, before start to resolve one of our tasks, the crowd workers were instructed with details and ex- amples about each quality issue. After reading the in- structions, workers proceed to resolve the given task. Figure 3 depicts the interface of a microtask generated for the Find stage in our approach. To display each triple, we retrieved the values of the foaf:name or rdfs:label properties for subjects, predicates, and datatypes. The name of languages in language-tagged strings were parsed using a conversion table from the best current practices BCP 47 [7], as suggested by the RDF specification 7 . Language tags and datatypes of objects were highlighted, such that workers can easily iden tify them 8 . Additionally, in order to provide contextual information, we implemented a simple wrapper which extracts the corresponding data encoded in the infobox of the Wikipedia article associated with the resource – specified via foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf . The crowd has the pos- sibility to select one or several quality issues per triple.""" .

This algorithm groups the triples in T obtained from the previous stage by quality issue, which enables the workers to focus on one quality issue at the time. The input of this stage is the set of triples to assess T and their mappings to quality issues φ̇(.). The parameter β specifies the number of questions to include in a single microtask. The algorithm firstly performs a pruning step (line 2) to remove certain triples. For instance, a triple t that was considered ‘correct’ in the Find stage ( φ̇(t) = ∅) is discarded, consistently with the definition of the Find-Fix-Verify pattern [3]. Also, in our implementation, the function prune discards answers whose inter-rater agreement were not higher than a certian value. The algorithm then proceeds to build microtasks such that each microtask only contains triples associated with a specific quality issue. For each answer from the previous stage, the algorithm decomposes the set of quality issues φ̇(t) of a triple t into singletons (lines 3-7). The set Q contains all the quality issues present in the set of triples T (line 8). For each quality issue q (line 9), the algorithm processes all triples associated with that quality issue (lines 11-18). The algorithm extracts human-readable information about the triples (line 12) and appends it to the microtask (line 13). In case that the number of questions in the current microtask exceeds the threshold β, a new microtask is then created. The outcome of the algorithm is a set M of microtasks to assess the quality of the triples in T according to the issues iden- tified in the Find stage ( φ̇(.)).""" .

We provided the worker examples of incorrect and correct examples along with four options (as shown in Figure 1): (i) ‘Correct’; (ii) ‘Incorrect’; (iii) ‘I cannot tell/I don’t know’; (iv) ‘Data doesn’t make sense’. The third option was meant to allow the user to specify when the question or values were unclear. The fourth option referred to those cases in which the presented data was truly unintelligible. Furthermore, the workers were not aware that the presented triples were previously identified as ‘incorrect’ in the Find stage and the questions were designed such that workers could not foresee the right answer. We describe the particularities of the interfaces of the microtask generated for the Verify stage in the following.""" .

2. syntactic structures: the Pattern Ontology [9] permits the segmentation of the structure of digital documents into a small number of atomic components, a set of the structural patterns that can be manipulated independently and re-used in different contexts;

3. structural semantics: DoCO, the Document Components Ontology [5] provides a vocabulary for the structural document components (paragraph, section, list, figure, table, etc.); and

4. rhetorical components: DEO, the Discourse Elements Ontology [5] provides a structured vocabulary for rhetorical elements within documents (introduction, discussion, acknowledgements, etc.).""" .

However, occasionally, it would be possible to generalise these assignments so as to have the same pattern specified for all the instances of the same element – e.g. in the previous example, all the instances of “x” assigned to the pattern atom can be safely assigned to the pattern inline since it is more flexible, allowing the containment of both text nodes and markup elements. This operation of harmonisation, applied to all the pattern assignments of a document, aims at reaching the local coherence of the assignments (function reach_local_coherence) – i.e. the situation in which all the instances of each markup element in a document are assigned to the same pattern. It is worth mentioning that there are situations where such local coherence cannot be reached for some documents. In these cases, all their pattern assignments are removed, so as not to be processed by the following rules. In addition, this harmonisation operation can be applied to all the instances of all the markup elements contained in all the documents that have been found locally coherent. In this case, we talk about reaching the global coherence of the pattern assignments across the corpus of documents (function reach_global_coherence).

in a community (e.g., a conference proceedings or a journal) that uses a permissive non-pattern-based markup language, most authors nevertheless use a pattern-based subset of such language for writing their scholarly articles. This conclusion has been derived by analysing the outcomes of the algorithm execution, as illustrated in [9];

only a small number of pattern-based documents coming from different communities of authors, all stored using the same markup language, is needed for automatically generating generic visualisations for all documents stored in that markup language (regardless of whether they are pattern-based or not) included in the communities in consideration. This conclusion has been empirically demonstrated by developing a prototypical tool, called PViewer, which implements such automatic visualisation mechanism, as introduced in [9].""" .

The most important issue is this: since CISE focusses on article parts that must be clearly marked-up in some way, all the other portions of the article text are simply discarded. By design, CISE does not undertake the analysis of natural language text. There are several existing applications, such as Named Entity Recognition tools (NER) [15] and other NLP technologies (e.g. [34]), that can be used for this purpose.""" .

The most limiting is the requirement that the article to be analysed should be appropriately marked up by means of some (e.g. XML-based) markup language. While it is not necessary to know the particular grammar and vocabulary of the markup language used, it is crucial that the article parts are organised hierarchically according to appropriate containment principles. For instance, in an HTML-based article, all the section-subsection relations should be explicitly defined by means of nested section elements. The common usage of headings of different levels (i.e. h1–h6 elements) within a flat structure (e.g. an article element) is inadequate for this, since it does not explicitly define the intended hierarchical organisation of the sections.5""" .

In particular, while scholarly documents can be written in different natural languages, their main constituents common across the whole scholarly communication domain. Of course, the presentation of research articles can vary according to the particular domain – e.g. Life Sciences articles usually follow a well-defined structure, while Computer Science articles are usually organised in a less conservative way. However, they all follow generic underlying ways of organising the arguments supporting the research conclusions – even if some aspects are more commonly found in one domain rather than another (e.g. Life Science articles typically have a Background section, while Computer Science articles have a Related Works section, whose function, while similar, is different in important aspects). Nevertheless, my hypothesis (partially supported by existing studies, e.g. [26]) is that many of the ways of organising research articles are shared across the various research areas.""" .

While these do not address all the layers of annotations sketched in Section 3, I think the outcomes described in Section 5 are acceptable pointers for claiming that some level of automatic semantic enhancement of scholarly articles is possible even in the presence of specific constraints such as the independence from the natural language used for writing such articles and the markup language used for storing their contents. Thus CISE provides at least a partial positive answer to the research question presented in Section 1: “Can the purely syntactic organisation of the various parts of a scholarly article convey something about its semantic and rhetorical representation, and to what extent?”. In the future, I plan to perform additional studies and experiments to further validate this claim.""" .

We base our approach on the analysis of the most common errors encountered in Linked Data sources, and a classification of these errors according to the extent to which they are likely to be amenable to crowdsourcing. We then propose and compare different crowdsourcing approaches to identify these Linked Data quality issues, employing the DBpedia dataset as our use case: (i) a contest targeting the Linked Data expert community, and (ii) paid microtasks published on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We secondly focus on adapting the Find-Fix-Verify crowdsourcing pattern to exploit the strengths of experts and lay workers. By testing two distinct Find-Verify workflows (lay users only and experts verified by lay users) we reveal how to best combine different crowds’ complementary aptitudes in quality issue detection. The results show that a combination of the two styles of crowdsourcing is likely to achieve more efficient results than each of them used in isolation, and that human computation is a promising and affordable way to enhance the quality of Linked Data.""" .

This is the result of a combination of data- and process- related factors. The data sets being released into the LOD Cloud are – apart from any factual flaws they may contain – very diverse in terms of formats, struc- ture, and vocabulary.

		c4o:hasContent """Crowdsourcing [19] refers to the process of solving a problem formulated as a task by reaching out to a large network of (often previously unknown) people. One of the most popular forms of crowdsourcing are ‘microtasks’ (or ‘microwork’), which consists on di- viding a task into several smaller subtasks that can be independently solved. Conditional on the tackled prob- lem, the level of task granularity can vary (microtasks whose results need to be aggregated vs. macrotasks, which require filtering to identify the most valuable contributions); as can the incentive structure (e.g., pay- ments per unit of useful work vs. prizes for top par- ticipants in a contest). Another major design decision in the crowdsourcing workflow is the selection of the crowd. While many (micro)tasks can be performed by untrained workers, others might require more skilled human participants, especially in specialized fields of expertise, such as LD. Of course, expert intervention usually comes at a higher price; either in monetary re- wards or in the form of effort to recruit participants in another setting, such as volunteer work. Microtask crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) 1 on the other hand offer a formidable and readily-available workforce at relatively low fees.""" .

We did so building on previous work of ours [43] which analyzed common quality prob- lems encountered in Linked Data sources and classi- fied them according to the extent to which they could be amenable to crowdsourcing. The first research ques- tion explored is hence: RQ1: Is it feasible to detect quality issues in LD sets via crowdsourcing mecha- nisms? This question aims at establishing a general un- derstanding if crowdsourcing approaches can be used to find issues in LD sets and if so, to what degree they are an efficient and effective solution. Secondly, given the option of different crowds, we formulate RQ2: In a crowdsourcing approach, can we employ unskilled lay users to identify quality issues in RDF triple data or to what extent is expert validation needed and desirable? As a subquestion to RQ2, we also examined which type of crowd is most suitable to detect which type of quality issue (and, conversely, which errors they are prone to make). With these questions, we are interested (i) in learning to what extent we can exploit the cost- efficiency of lay users, or if the quality of error detec- tion is prohibitively low. We (ii) investigate how well experts generally perform in a crowdsourcing setting and if and how they outperform lay users. And lastly, (iii) it is of interest if one of the two distinct approaches performs well in areas that might not be a strength of the other method and crowd.""" .

The task consisted solely of the rating of a formerly indicated quality is- sue for a triple as correctly or wrongly assigned. This Verify step was, in fact, able to improve the preci- sion of both Find stages substantially. In particular, the experts’ Find stage results could be improved to precision levels of around 0.9 in the Verify stage for two error types which showed to score much lower for an expert-only Find approach. The worker-worker Find-Verify strategy yielded also better results than the Find-only worker approach, and for one error type even reached slightly better precision than the expert-worker model. All in all, we show that (i) a Find-Verify combination of experts and lay users is likely to pro- duce the best results, but that (ii) they are not superior to expert-only evaluation in all cases.

In our previous work [44], we compiled a list of data quality dimensions (criteria) applica- ble to Linked Data quality assessment. Afterwards, we mapped these dimensions to DBpedia [43]. A sub-set of four dimensions of the original framework were found particularly relevant in this setting: Ac- curacy, Relevancy, Representational-Consistency and Interlinking. To provide a comprehensive analysis of DBpedia quality, we further divided these four cate- gories of problems into sub-categories.

The idea, originating from open innovation, has been employed in many domains, from creative industries to sciences, for tasks of varying complexity (from designing logos to building sophisticated algorithms). In particular, contests as means to successfully involve experts in advancing science have a long-standing tradition in research, e.g., the Darpa challenges 3 and NetFlix. 4 Usually, contests as crowdsourcing mechanisms are open for a medium to long period of time in order to attract high quality contributions. Contests may apply different reward models, but a common modality is to define one main prize for the contest winner.""" .

The second workflow entirely relies on microtask crowdsourcing to perform the Find and Verify stages. As discussed in Section 3, these crowdsourcing approaches exhibit different characteristics in terms of the types of tasks they can be applied to, the way the results are consolidated and exploited, and the audiences they target. Therefore, in this work we study the impact on involving different types of crowd to detect quality issues in RDF triples: LD experts in the contest and workers in the microtasks.

In addition, a parameter α can be specified as a threshold on the number of questions to include in a single microtask. Algorithm 1 presents the procedure to create the microtasks. The algorithm firstly per- forms a pruning step (line 2) to remove triples that do not require human assessment. For instance, in our im- plementation, the function prune discards RDF triples whose URIs could not be dereferenced. The algorithm then proceeds to build microtasks such that each microtask only contains triples associated with a specific resource, similar to the interfaces of the TripleCheck-Mate tool used in the contest. The set S contains all the resources that appear as subjects in the set of triples T (line 3). For each subject, the algorithm builds the set of triples T 0 associated with the subject (line 5), and the creation of microtasks begins (line 6). From the pool T 0 , a triple t is selected (line 8) and the corresponding human-readable information is extracted (line 9). In this stage, similar to the TripleCheckMate, each microtask requires the workers to browse all the possible quality issues, therefore, the set of issues to assess on triple t is equal to Q in each microtask cre- ated (line 10). In case that the number of questions in the current microtask exceeds the threshold α, a new microtask is then created. The definition of the parameter α allows for avoiding the creation of very long tasks, i.e., when the number of triples with the same subject is large; appropriate values of α enables the creation of tasks than can still be solved in a reasonable time, consistent with the concept of microtask (a short task). Algorithm 1 continues creating microtasks for all the triples of a resource (lines 7-16), for all the resources (lines 4-18). The outcome of the algorithm is a set M of microtasks to assess the quality of the triples in T according to the issues in Q.""" .

		c4o:hasContent """An important aspect when generating microtasks from RDF data (or machine-readable data in general) is developing useful human-understandable interfaces (Algorithm 1, line 9) for the target non-expert crowds. In microtasks, optimal user interfaces reduce ambigu- ity as well as the probability to retrieve erroneous answers from the crowd due to a misinterpretation of the task. Therefore, before start to resolve one of our tasks, the crowd workers were instructed with details and ex- amples about each quality issue. After reading the in- structions, workers proceed to resolve the given task. Figure 3 depicts the interface of a microtask generated for the Find stage in our approach. To display each triple, we retrieved the values of the foaf:name or rdfs:label properties for subjects, predicates, and datatypes. The name of languages in language-tagged strings were parsed using a conversion table from the best current practices BCP 47 [7], as suggested by the RDF specification 7 . Language tags and datatypes of objects were highlighted, such that workers can easily iden tify them 8 . Additionally, in order to provide contextual information, we implemented a simple wrapper which extracts the corresponding data encoded in the infobox of the Wikipedia article associated with the resource – specified via foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf . The crowd has the pos- sibility to select one or several quality issues per triple.""" .

This algorithm groups the triples in T obtained from the previous stage by quality issue, which enables the workers to focus on one quality issue at the time. The input of this stage is the set of triples to assess T and their mappings to quality issues φ̇(.). The parameter β specifies the number of questions to include in a single microtask. The algorithm firstly performs a pruning step (line 2) to remove certain triples. For instance, a triple t that was considered ‘correct’ in the Find stage ( φ̇(t) = ∅) is discarded, consistently with the definition of the Find-Fix-Verify pattern [3]. Also, in our implementation, the function prune discards answers whose inter-rater agreement were not higher than a certian value. The algorithm then proceeds to build microtasks such that each microtask only contains triples associated with a specific quality issue. For each answer from the previous stage, the algorithm decomposes the set of quality issues φ̇(t) of a triple t into singletons (lines 3-7). The set Q contains all the quality issues present in the set of triples T (line 8). For each quality issue q (line 9), the algorithm processes all triples associated with that quality issue (lines 11-18). The algorithm extracts human-readable information about the triples (line 12) and appends it to the microtask (line 13). In case that the number of questions in the current microtask exceeds the threshold β, a new microtask is then created. The outcome of the algorithm is a set M of microtasks to assess the quality of the triples in T according to the issues iden- tified in the Find stage ( φ̇(.)).""" .

This is a consequence of simplifying the difficulty of the microtasks in the Verify stage, where workers have to assess only one type of quality issue at the time. However, in practice, the number of microtasks generated in the Verify stage is not necessarily larger. For instance, in our experiments with LD experts and crowd workers, we ob- served that large portions of the triples are not anno- tated with quality issues in the Find stage. Since Algorithm 2 prunes triples with no quality issues (consistently with the definition of the Find-Fix-Verify pattern), the subset of triples crowdsourced in the Verify stage is considerably smaller than the original set, hence the number of microtasks to verify is reduced.""" .

		c4o:hasContent """Two of the authors of this paper (MA, AZ) generated a gold standard for two samples of the crowd- sourced triples. To generate the gold standard, each author independently evaluated the triples. After an individual assessment, they compared their results and resolved the conflicts via mutual agreement. The first sample evaluated corresponds to the set of triples obtained from the contest and submitted to MTurk. The inter-rater agreement between the authors for this first sample and was 0.4523 for object values, 0.5554 for datatypes, and 0.5666 for interlinks. For the second sample, we analyzed a subset from the triples identified in the Find stage by the crowd as ‘incorrect’. The subset has the same distribution of quality issues and triples as the one assessed in the first sample: 509 triples for object values, 341 for datatypes/language tags, and 223 for interlinks. We measured the inter- rater agreement for this second sample and was 0.6363 for object values, 0.8285 for datatypes, and 0.7074 for interlinks. The inter-rater agreement values were calculated using the Cohen’s kappa measure [6], designed for measuring agreement among two annotators. Dis- agreement arose in the object value triples when one of the reviewers marked number values which are rounded up to the next round number as correct. For example, the length of the course of the “1949 Ulster Grand Prix” was 26.5Km in Wikipedia but rounded up to 27Km in DBpedia. In case of datatypes, most dis- agreements were considering the datatype “number” of the value for the property “year” as correct. For the links, those containing unrelated content, were marked as correct by one of the reviewers since the link existed in the Wikipedia page.""" .

In total, there were 268 inter-evaluations for which we calculated the triple-based inter-agreement (adjusting the observed agreement with agreement by chance) to be 0.38. For the microtasks, we measured the inter-rater agreement values between a maximum of 5 workers for each type of task using Fleiss’ kappa measure [10]. While the inter-rater agreement between workers for the interlinking was high (0.7396), the ones for object values and datatypes was moderate to low with 0.5348 and 0.4960, respectively.

Most of the missing or incomplete values that are extracted from Wikipedia occur with the predicates related to dates, for example: (2005 Six Nations Championship, Date, 12). In these cases, the experts and workers presented a similar behavior, classifying 110 and 107 triples correctly, respectively, out of the 117 assessed triples for this class. The difference in precision between the two approaches can be explained as follows. There were 52 DBpedia triples whose values might seem erroneous, although they were cor- rectly extracted from Wikipedia. One example of these triples is: (English (programming language), Influenced by, ?) . We found out that the LD experts classified all these triples as incorrect. In contrast, the workers successfully answered that 50 out of this 52 were correct, since they could easily compare the DB- pedia and Wikipedia values in the HITs.""" .

We calculated the frequency of occurrences of datatypes in the assessed triples (see Figure 6a) and reported the number of true positives (TP) and false positives (FP) achieved by both crowdsourcing methods for each type of task. Figure 6b depicts these results. The most notorious result in this task is the assessment performance for the datatype “number”. The experts effectively identified triples where the datatype was incorrectly assigned as “number” 13 for instance, in the triple where the crowd was confused and determined that datatype was correct, thus generating a large number of false positives. Nevertheless, it could be argued that the data type “number” in the previous example is not completely incorrect, when being unaware of the fact that there are more specific data types for representing time units. Under this assumption, the precision of the crowd would have been 0.8475 and 0.8211 for first answer and majority voting, respectively.""" .

In comparison to the first workflow, the crowd in the Verify stage achieved higher agreement. This suggests that the triples identified as erroneous in the Find stage were easier to interpret or process by the crowd. Table 6 reports on the precision achieved by the crowd in each stage. It is important to notice that in this workflow we crowdsourced all the triples that could have been explored by the LD experts in the contest. In this way, we evaluate the performance of lay user and experts under similar conditions. During the Find stage, the crowd achieved low values of precision for the three types of tasks, which suggests that this stage is still very challenging for lay users.

Out of the 341 analyzed triples, 307 triples identified as ‘erroneous’ in this stage were annotated with language tags. As reported on Table 6, the crowd in the Find stage achieved a precision of 0.1466, being the lowest precision achieved in all the microtask settings. Most of the triples (72 out of 341) identified as ‘incorrect’ in this stage were annotated with the English language tag.

This major improvement on the precision put in evidence the importance of having the a multi-validation pattern like Find-Fix-Verify in which initial errors can be reduced in subsequent iterations. Congruently with the behavior observed in the first workflow, MTurk workers perform well when verifying language-tagged literals. Further- more, the high values of inter-rater agreement con- firms that the crowd is consistently good in this par- ticular scenario. Figure 7b depicts the results of the ‘majority voting’ setting when classifying triples correctly, i.e., true positives (TP) and true negatives (TN), vs. misclassifying triples, i.e. false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN). We can observe that the crowd is exceptionally successful in identifying correct triples that were classified as erroneous in the previous stage (true negatives). This can be confirmed by the high value of accuracy 17 (0.9531) achieved by the crowd in this stage with ‘majority voting’. A closer inspection to the six false positives revealed that in three cases the crowd misclassified triples whose object is a proper noun, for instance, (Tiszaszentimre, name, Tiszaszen- timre@en) and (Ferrari Mythos, label, Ferrari Mythos@de) ; in the other three cases the object of the triple corresponds to a common noun or text in the following languages: Italian, Portuguese, and English, for example, (Book, label, Libro@it) .""" .

From the 167 RDF triples with predicate rdf:type, the crowd correctly classified 67 triples. Although the false positives were reduced in the Verify stage, the number of misclassified triples with RDF resources as objects are still high. Since the value of inter-rater agreement for this type of task is high, we can deduce that false positives are not necessarily generated by chance but the crowd recurrently confirms that these RDF triples are incorrect. These results suggest that assessing triples with RDF resources as objects without a proper rendering (human-readable information) is challenging for the crowd. Regarding the triples whose objects are external Web pages, in the Find stage the crowd correctly classified 35 out of the 36 triples, which is consistent with the behavior observed for this type of triples assessed in the Verify stage of the first workflow.""" .

However, even in this case it is not possible to provide a precision since RDFUnit runs through the whole set of resources and possibly catches errors the LD experts didn’t catch since it considers the ontological schema. This is because the LD experts performed triple based evalua- tion using the TripleCheckMate tool, which does not provide schema information directly. Thus, only those experts who are conversant with the schema might be able to identify those errors. Examples of such inconsistencies are datatype detection that is not defined in the ontology e.g. dates vs numbers (“1935”ˆˆxsd:integer ) or erroneous language tags. Also, rdfs:domain violations were not reported from the LD experts since for every triple they had to cross-check the ontology definitions for the evaluated property and the rdf:type statements of the resource. Similar combinations apply for all the other patterns types described in Table 8. RDFUnit was running beyond the isolated triple level that the LD experts and crowd were evaluating and was checking various combinations of triples.""" .

In the same type of task, workers focused on assessing triples annotated with language tags, instead of datatypes like the experts. The MTurk crowd has proven to be very skilled at verifying whether literals are written in a certain language.

In microtask settings, the first challenge is then to reduce the amount of tasks submitted to the crowd and the number of requested assign- ments (different answers), since both of these factors determine the overall cost of crowdsourcing projects. For the Find stage, Algorithm 1 generated 2, 339 HITs to crowdsource 68, 976 RDF triples, consistently with the property stated by Proposition 2. In our experiments, we approved a total of 2, 294 task solutions in the Find stage and, considering the payment per HIT (US$ 0.06), the total cost of this evaluation resulted in US$ 137.58. Furthermore, in the Verify stage, the cost of submitting to MTurk the problematic triples found by the experts was only US$ 43.""" .

		c4o:hasContent """From a process point of view, [41] introduced a methodology for publishing Linked Data. They dis- cussed activities which theoretically could be subject to crowdsourcing, but did not discuss such aspects explicitly. Similarly, [25] tried to map ontology engineering methodologies to Linked Data practice, drawing on insights from interviews with practitioners and quantitative analysis. A more focused account of the use of human and crowd intelligence in Linked Data man- agement is offered in [36]. The authors investigated several technically oriented scenarios in order to identify lower-level tasks and analyze the extent to which they can be feasibly automated. In this context, feasibility referred primarily to the trade-off between the effort associated with the usage of a given tool targeting automation - including aspects such as getting familiar with the tool, but more importantly creating training data sets and examples, configuring the tool and validating (intermediary) results - and the quality of the outcomes. The fundamental question the work attempted to answer was related to ours, though not focused on quality assurance and repair – their aim was come up with patterns for human and machine-driven computation, which could service semantic data management scenarios effectively. This was also at the core of [35], which took the main findings of this analysis a step further and proposed a methodology to build incentivized Semantic Web applications, including guidelines for mechanism design which are compatible to our fix-find-verify workflow. They have also analyzed motivators and incentives for several types of Semantic Web tasks, from ontology population to se- mantic annotation.""" .

Games with a purpose, which capitalize on entertain- ment, intellectual challenge, competition, and reputation, offer another mechanism to engage with a broad user base. In the field of semantic technologies, the OntoGame series proposes several games that deal with the task of data interlinking, be that in its ontology alignment instance (SpotTheLink [38]) or multimedia interlinking (SeaFish [37]). Similar ideas are imple- mented in GuessWhat?!, a selection-agreement game which uses URIs from DBpedia, Freebase and OpenCyc as input to the interlinking process [27]. While OntoGame looks into game mechanics and game narratives and their applicability to finding similar enti- ties and other types of correspondences, our research studies an alternative crowdsourcing strategy that is based on financial rewards in a microtask platform. Most relevant for our work are the experiments comparing games with a purpose and paid microtasks, which showed the complementarity of the two forms of crowdsourcing [32,9].""" .

Existing frameworks for the quality assessment of the Web of Data can be broadly classified as automated (e.g. [15]), semiautomated (e.g. [11]) and manual (e.g.[4,29]). In particular, for the quality issues used in our experiments, [15] performs quality assessment on links but it fully automated and thus is limited as it does allow the user to choose the input dataset. Also, the incor- rect interlinks detected require human verification as they do not take the semantics into account. On the other hand, for detection of incorrect object values and datatypes and literals, the SWIQA framework [14] can be used by utilizing different outlier and clustering techniques. However, it lacks specific syntactical rules to detect all of the errors and requires knowledge of the underlying schema for the user to specify these rules. Other researchers analyzed the quality of Web [5] and RDF [17] data. The second study focuses on errors occurred during the publication of Linked Data sets. Recently, a study [18] looked into four million RD- F/XML documents to analyze Linked Data conformance. These studies performed large-scale quality assessment on LD but are often limited in their ability to produce interpretable results, demand user expertise or are bound to a given data set.""" .

Finally, as with any form of computing, our work will be most useful as part of a broader architecture, in which crowdsourcing is brought together with automatic quality assessment and repair components and integrated into existing data governance frameworks.""" .

In the longer term, we will also concern ourselves with the question of how to optimally integrate crowd contributions – by implementing the Fix stage – into curation processes and tools, in particular with respect to the trade-offs of costs and quality between manual and automatic ap- proaches. Another area of research is the integration of baseline approaches before the crowdsourcing step in order to filter out errors that can be detected automatically to further increase the productivity of both LD experts and crowd workers.""" .

This motivates the need for Intelligent Web-reading Agents: hypothetically, they would skim through disparate Web sources corpora and generate meaningful structured assertions to fuel Knowledge Bases (KBs). Ultimately, comprehensive KBs, like Wikidata and DBpedia, play a fundamental role to cope with the issue of information overload. On account of such vision, this paper depicts the F ACT E XTRACTOR , a complete Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline which reads an input textual corpus and produces machine-readable statements. Each statement is supplied with a confidence score and undergoes a disambiguation step via entity linking, thus allowing the assignment of KB-compliant URIs. The system implements four research contributions: it (1) executes N-ary relation extraction by applying the Frame Semantics linguistic theory, as opposed to binary techniques; it (2) jointly populates both the T-Box and the A-Box of the target KB; it (3) relies on a lightweight NLP machinery, namely part-of-speech tagging only; it (4) enables a completely supervised yet reasonably priced machine learning environment through a crowdsourcing strategy. We assess our approach by setting the target KB to DBpedia and by considering a use case of 52, 000 Italian Wikipedia soccer player articles. Out of those, we yield a dataset of more than 213, 000 triples with a 78.5% F 1 . We corroborate the evaluation via (i) a performance comparison with a baseline system, as well as (ii) an analysis of the T-Box and A-Box augmentation capabilities. The outcomes are incorporated into the Italian DBpedia chapter, can be queried through its SPARQL endpoint, and/or downloaded as standalone data dumps. The codebase is released as free software and is publicly available in the DBpedia Association repository.""" .

De- spite the constantly increasing availability of semi-structured or structured data, a major portion of its content is still represented in an unstructured form, namely free text: deciphering its meaning is a complex task for machines and yet relies on subjective human interpretations. Hence, there is an ever growing need for Intelligent Web-reading Agents, i.e., Artificial Intelligence systems that can read and understand human language in documents across the Web. Ideally, these agents should be robust enough to interchange between heterogeneous sources with agility, while maintaining equivalent reading capabilities. More specifically, given a set of input corpora (where an item corresponds to the textual content of a Web source), they should be able to navigate from corpus to corpus and to extract compa- rable structured assertions out of each one. Ultimately, the collected data would feed a target Knowledge Base (KB), namely a repository that encodes areas of human intelligence into a richly shaped representation. Typically, KBs are composed of graphs, where real-world and abstract entities are bound together through relationships, and classified according to a formal description of the world, i.e., an ontology.""" .

Even though the Wikidata community strongly agrees on the concern, 6 few efforts have been approached towards this direction. The addition of references to external (i.e., non-Wikimedia), authoritative Web sources can be viewed as a form of validation. Consequently, such real-world setting further consolidates the need for an intelligent agent that harvests structured data from raw text and produces e.g., Wikidata statements with reference URLs. Besides the prospective impact on the KB augmentation and quality, the agent would also dramatically shift the burden of manual data addition and curation, by pushing the (intended) fully human-driven flow towards an assisted paradigm, where automatic suggestions of pre-packaged statements just require to be approved or rejected. Figure 1 depicts the current state of the primary sources tool interface for Wikidata editors, which is in active development yet illustrates such future technological directions. Our system already takes part in the process, as it feeds the tool back-end.""" .

The main purpose of Information Extraction is to gather structured data from free text via Natural Language Processing (NLP), while Frame Semantics originates from linguistic research in Artificial Intelligence. A frame can be informally defined as an event triggered by some term in a text and embedding a set of participants, or Frame Elements (FEs). Hence, the aforementioned sentence would induce the DEFEAT frame (triggered by lost) together with the WINNER, COMPETITION, and SCORE participants. Such theory has led to the creation of FRAME NET [5,6], namely a lexical database with manually annotated examples of frame usage in English. FrameNet currently adheres to a rigorous protocol for data annotation and quality control. The activity is known to be expensive with respect to time and cost, thus constituting an encumbrance for the extension of the resource [4], both in terms of additional labeled sentences and of languages. To alleviate this, crowdsourcing the annotation task is proven to dramatically reduce the financial and temporal expenses. Consequently, we foresee to exploit the novel annotation approach described in [18], which provides full frame annotation in a single step and in a bottom-up fashion, thus being also more compliant with the definition of frames as per [17].""" .

To achieve this, we leverage the WIKI EXTRACTOR , 13 a third-party tool that retains the text and expands templates of a Wikipedia XML dump, while discarding other data such as tables, references, images, etc. We note that the tool is not completely robust with respect to templates expansion. Such drawback is expected for two reasons: first, new templates are constantly defined, thus requiring regular maintenance of the tool; second, Wikipedia editors do not always comply to the specifications of the templates they include. Therefore, we could not obtain a fully cleaned Wikipedia plain text corpus, and noticed gaps in its content, probably due to template expansion failures. Nevertheless, we argue that the loss of information is not significant and can be neglected despite the recall cost. From the entire Italian Wikipedia corpus, we slice the use case subset by querying the I TALIAN DBPEDIA CHAPTER 14 for the Wikipedia article IDs of relevant entities.""" .

Although our input has a relatively low dimension (i.e., 7.25 million tokens circa), we observe that the tool is not able to handle it as a whole, since it crashes with a segmentation fault even on a powerful machine (i.e., 24 cores CPU at 2.53 GHz, 64 GB RAM). Consequently, we had to run it over each document, thus impacting on the processing time. However, we believe that further investigation will lead to the optimization of such issue.""" .

Two measures are combined to generate a score for each verb lemma, thus enabling the creation of a rank. We first compute the term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) of each verb lexicalization (i.e., the occurring tokens) over each document in the corpus: this weighting measure is intended to capture the lexi- cographical relevance of a given verb, namely how important it is with respect to other terms in the whole corpus. Then, we determine the standard deviation value out of the TF-IDF scores list: this statistical measure is meant to catch heterogeneously distributed verbs, in the sense that the higher the standard deviation is, the more variably the verb is used, thus helping to understand its overall usage signal over the corpus. Ultimately, we produce the final score and assign it to a verb lemma by averaging all its lexicalizations scores. The top-N lemmas serve as candidate LUs, each evoking one or more frames according to the definitions of a given frame repository.""" .

Such activity boils down to semantic role labeling (cf. [24] for an introduction), and usually requires a more fine-grained text analysis. Previous work in the area exploits deeper NLP layers, such as syntactic parsing (e.g., [25]). We alleviate this through EL techniques, which perform word sense dis- ambiguation by linking relevant parts of a source sentence to URIs of a target KB. We leverage THE WIKI MACHINE 17 [19], a state-of-the-art [26] approach conceived for connecting text to Wikipedia URLs, thus inherently entailing DBpedia URIs. EL results are part of the FE classifier feature set. We claim that EL enables the automatic addition of features based on existing entity attributes within the target KB (notably, the class of an entity, which represents its semantic type).""" .

On the other hand, the cus- tom chunker was the fastest one, but still too noisy to be crowdsourced. EL resulted in the best trade-off, and we adopted it for the final task. Obviously, noise cannot be automatically eliminated: we cast such validation to the crowd by allowing the None answer along with the candidate FE labels.""" .

		c4o:hasContent """To enable a performance evaluation comparison with the supervised method, we developed a rule-based algorithm that handles the full frame and FEs annotation. The main intuition is to map FEs defined in the frame repository to ontology classes of the target KB: such mapping serves as a set of rule pairs (FE, class), e.g., (WINNER , SoccerClub). In the FrameNet terminology, this is homologous to the assignment of semantic types to FEs: for instance, in the ACTIVITY frame, the AGENT is typed with the generic class Sentient. The idea would allow the implementation of the bottom-up one-step annotation flow described in [18]: to achieve this, we run EL over the input sentences and check whether the attached ontology class metadata appear in the frame repository, thus fulfilling the FE classification task.""" .

The implementation workflow is illustrated in Algorithm 1: it takes as input the set S of sentences, the frame repository F embedding frame and FEs labels, core/non-core annotations and rule pairs, and the set L of trigger LU tokens.""" .

We achieve this with a (3) shallow layer of NLP technology only, namely grammatical analysis, instead of more sophisticated ones, such as syntactic parsing. Finally, we ensure a (4) fully supervised learning paradigm via an affordable crowdsourcing methodology. Our work concurrently bears the advantages and leaves out the weaknesses of RE and OIE: although we assess it in a closed-domain fashion via a use case (Section 3), the corpus analysis module (Section 5) allows to discover an exhaustive set of relations in an open-domain way. In addition, we overcome the supervision cost bottleneck trough crowdsourcing. Therefore, we believe our approach can represent a trade-off between open-domain high noise and closed-domain high cost.""" .
